Notifications
=============

This is your Notifications page, where you can manage your preferences and view alerts related to your account activity and services.

My Settings[​](/general/customer-portal/Notifications#my-settings "Direct link to My Settings")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is your **Settings page**, located within the "Notifications" section. This page allows you to customize a wide array of notification preferences across different categories, each controlled by a simple toggle switch - ON and OFF.

Here are the available notification settings, organized by section:

* **Technical Issues**
  + **API Key Authorization Rejected**: "Notify me when authorization using API Key will be rejected."
* **Subscription Quota Usage**
  + **Subscription Quota Used 75% Threshold**: "Notify when any current quota from subscription will exceed 75% threshold, no more than once per calendar month per organization."
  + **Subscription Quota Exceeded 100% Threshold**: "Notify when any current quota from subscription will exceed 100% threshold, no more than once per calendar month per organization."
* **Spend Management**
  + **Spend Management Notify Limit**: "When Spend Management Notify Limit is enabled, then include me as user who should be notified when the limit is hit, no more than once per day."
  + **Spend Management Hard Limit**: "When Spend Management Hard Limit is enabled, then include me as user who should be notified when the limit is hit, no more than once per day."
* **Subscriptions**
  + **Subscription Created**: "Notify me when the subscription is created on my organization account."
  + **Subscription Updated**: "Notify me when the subscription is updated on my organization account."
  + **Subscription Cancelled**: "Notify me when the subscription is cancelled on my organization account."
  + **Subscription Terminated**: "Notify me when the subscription is terminated on my organization account."
  + **Subscription Reactivated**: "Notify me when the subscription is reactivated on my organization account."
* **Invoices**
  + **Invoice Created**: "Notify me when new invoice is created."
  + **Invoice Paid**: "Notify me when new invoice is paid."
  + **Invoice Payment Failed**: "Notify me when payment failed on the invoice."
  + **Invoice Voided**: "Notify me when the invoice was voided."
* **Notifications**
  + **Notification Settings**: "Notify me when organization notification email settings will change."
* **API Usage Credits**
  + **Credits Auto-recharge Failed**: "Notify me when auto-recharge of the credits is enabled and will fail."
  + **Credits Balance Low**: "Notify me when credits balance will fall below 10 USD."
  + **Credits Added**: "Notify me when credits were added on the organization account, either via the auto-recharge, manually or via other methods."

Additional Emails[​](/general/customer-portal/Notifications#additional-emails "Direct link to Additional Emails")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Additional Emails page** is located within the "Notifications" section. This page allows you to specify additional email addresses that will receive various types of notifications, in addition to those sent to team members based on their individual preferences. You can provide multiple emails in each field, separated by commas (,) or semicolons (;).

Here are the different email notification categories you can configure:

* **Billing Notifications Email**:
  + This is where invoices and other billing-related notifications will be sent. It's useful for routing these communications to a specific department or an invoice management system.
* **All Non-Billing Notifications Email**:
  + All notifications that are not billing-related will be sent to the address(es) specified here. This can help consolidate non-billing alerts, for example, by sending them to a dedicated Slack channel that has a unique email address.
* **Action Required Notifications Email**:
  + Notifications that require your action will be sent to the email(s) listed in this field. This is beneficial for centralizing urgent alerts, potentially routing them to services like PagerDuty or a specific Slack channel.

After entering or updating the email addresses in the respective fields, you would click the **"Save changes"** button at the bottom of the page to apply your configurations.

History page[​](/general/customer-portal/Notifications#history-page "Direct link to History page")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**History page** is located within the "Notifications" section. This page provides a log of all the notifications that have been sent, allowing you to review past alerts and communications.

Here's what you'll find on this page:

* **Controls at the Top**:
  + **"Filter Subject..."**: An input field that lets you search through the notification history by the subject line.
* **Notification History List**:
  + A table displays the record of sent notifications with the following details for each entry:
    - **Timestamp**: The date and time when the notification was sent.
    - **Email ID**: A unique identifier for the specific email notification that was sent.
    - **Subject**: The subject line or a brief description of the notification's content (e.g., "Credits Added to your Org," "Invoice has been paid" or "Alert: Contact notification email changed").
