The importance of real-time crypto prices for Satstreet
-------------------------------------------------------

Satstreet, a leading OTC desk in Canada, needs a reliable source of real-time crypto prices. This helps them provide the best trade execution services and accurate reporting to their clients. As the digital asset industry grows, Satstreet aims to offer accessible insights derived from complex crypto data.

To achieve this, Satstreet uses CoinAPI. This ensures their clients receive the most up-to-date and accurate pricing information. As a result, customers donâ€™t need to search for the latest prices manually. Consequently, this makes Satstreet one of the most trusted digital asset trading data sources.
