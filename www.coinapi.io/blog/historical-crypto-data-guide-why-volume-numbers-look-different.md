Historical Crypto Data Guide: Why Volume Numbers Look Different
===============================================================

![featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2Fa4f407df9d200512803e239ed37fc6e7ec84a233-1001x501.png%3Frect%3D0%2C34%2C1001%2C435%26w%3D920%26h%3D400&w=1920&q=75)

**Many analysts and devs ask the same question:**

***‚ÄúWhere can I find full historical crypto data, not just spot prices, but real depth and trades?‚Äù***

Most ‚Äúfree APIs‚Äù only offer shallow history, limited resolution, or inconsistent coverage across exchanges. Others have missing tick data or lack normalized schemas, making any serious backtesting unreliable.

These are exactly the challenges CoinAPI set out to solve.

Planning to backtest a new alpha strategy, train a machine learning model, or build a dataset for publication? You‚Äôll need clean, granular historical crypto data, and this guide walks you through exactly how to get it using CoinAPI, whether you're coding or downloading in bulk.

### **Sample datasets: try it yourself**

To help you get started, we‚Äôve included real historical sample files based on the BTC/USDT pair from Binance:

* [**Trades (tick-level)**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DsE6uPjlplJVB36lAAdM0b8OhFFZXktB/view?usp=sharing)
* [**Quotes (bid/ask updates)**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14ELuNe50BJTPn_QrrbDLrN2gXsl75sWF/view?usp=sharing)
* [**Order Book Snapshots (L2)**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1knqndTaUHP5VNY2_91HPIMyYMls-G1Kp/view?usp=sharing)
* [**OHLCV (1-minute bars)**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BLD_57TigtvRGsarWJxPMM9UXtwAD5mv/view?usp=sharing)

These files demonstrate CoinAPI‚Äôs schema consistency, timestamp precision, and normalized structure. Here's what each file shows:

Trades (Tick-Level)
-------------------

* Captures every executed trade on Binance for BTC/USDT
* Includes precise timestamps, price, and amount for each trade
* Useful for backtesting execution timing, simulating fills, or constructing VWAP/TWAP strategies

Quotes (Bid/Ask Updates)
------------------------

* Shows every update to the bid and ask price
* Ideal for analyzing spread changes, quote stability, or building quote-driven signals
* Crucial for modeling market liquidity without full order book complexity

Order Book Snapshots (L2)
-------------------------

* Snapshot of the full L2 order book depth at regular intervals
* Captures resting liquidity at each price level on both the bid and ask sides
* Useful for liquidity modeling, passive fill simulation, or understanding depth imbalance

OHLCV (1-Minute Bars)
---------------------

* Aggregated minute-by-minute bars with open, high, low, close, and volume
* Aligned to standard time intervals, ideal for time-series modeling
* Frequently used in ML models, risk dashboards, or basic charting engines

These samples are perfect for exploring CoinAPI‚Äôs structure before committing to larger historical downloads or API queries. Whether you're coding in Python, building dashboards in R, or benchmarking your strategy logic, these files offer a low-friction way to begin.

### The hidden cost of incomplete historical crypto data: time lost in cleanup

Many of our users come to CoinAPI after trying, and failing, to gather historical crypto data from scattered or unreliable sources. They‚Äôve downloaded fragmented CSVs, only to find mismatched timestamps, missing L2 snapshots, or inconsistent symbol formats across exchanges. As one data scientist from a crypto hedge fund told us: ***‚ÄúBacktesting shouldn‚Äôt start with three days of data cleaning.‚Äù*** That‚Äôs why CoinAPI provides plug-and-play historical datasets with unified schemas, millisecond precision, and full depth, so quants and engineers can spend less time fixing their data and more time modeling real strategy performance.

Understanding CoinAPI's Volume Data: Why Our Numbers May Look Different
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When working with CoinAPI's historical data, you might notice that our volume figures appear significantly higher than other data providers like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap. **This isn't an error, it's a comprehensive feature** that gives you the complete market picture.

What Makes CoinAPI Volume Data Different
----------------------------------------

While most providers only report **spot trading volumes**, CoinAPI aggregates data from **all market types** available on an exchange:

* **SPOT trading** (traditional buy/sell)
* **PERPETUAL futures**
* **FUTURES contracts**
* **OPTIONS trading**

This comprehensive approach means you're seeing the total trading interest across all instruments, not just a fraction of the market activity.

Real-World Example: Bitcoin Volume
----------------------------------

Here's what you might see when comparing the same timeframe:

* **CoinGecko reports**: ~$35 billion (spot only)
* **CoinAPI reports**: ~$1.196 trillion (all market types combined)

The significant difference comes from including derivatives trading, which often has 10-30x higher volume than spot markets, especially for major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

### Why This Comprehensive Approach Matters

Including all market types in your historical analysis provides:

1. **Complete liquidity picture**: Understand true market depth across all trading venues
2. **Institutional insight**: Derivatives volumes often indicate institutional and professional trader activity
3. **Better risk modeling**: Account for all sources of price discovery and market impact
4. **Realistic backtesting**: Your strategies will encounter this combined market reality

**As one of our banking clients noted:** *"We needed comprehensive market data that would give our clients the full picture of crypto market activity, not just fragments."* - [LUKB Digital Assets Team](https://www.coinapi.io/case-study/lukb-bridges-traditional-banking-and-digital-assets-with-coinapi-s-real-time-crypto-market-data-api)

### How to Work with This Data

If your analysis requires spot-only volumes (to match other providers), you can:

**Filter by symbol type:**

```
1# Get only spot BTC/USDT data from Binance
2GET /v1/ohlcv/BINANCE_SPOT_BTC_USDT/history
```

**Use symbol filtering:**

```
1# Filter for spot-only symbols across exchanges
2GET /v1/symbols?filter_symbol_id=SPOT
```

Target spot exchanges: Focus on exchanges that primarily offer spot trading.

**For a complete comparison of data access methods, see our guide:** [REST API or Flat Files? Choosing the Best Crypto Data Access Method](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/rest-api-or-flat-files-choosing-the-best-crypto-data-access-method)

### Turning Confusion into Competitive Advantage

Understanding this methodology helps you:

* Make informed decisions about which volume metrics to use
* Explain data discrepancies to stakeholders
* Leverage more comprehensive market data for better analysis
* Trust that you're getting the full market picture, not just a subset

Remember: **Most trading strategies will interact with this combined market reality.** Having access to comprehensive volume data from the start gives you a more accurate foundation for backtesting and analysis.

What quants really want from historical crypto data
---------------------------------------------------

Professionals in quant finance often struggle to find data infrastructure that meets their standards. They don‚Äôt just want price charts but raw trades, [L2/L3 order books](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/level-1-vs-level-2-vs-level-3-market-data-how-to-read-the-crypto-order-book), quote updates, and timestamps that hold up under scrutiny. Yet, even paid solutions often fall short, lacking depth, consistency, or complete sequencing. As one user put it: ***‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need pretty charts. I need reproducible data for serious models.‚Äù*** That‚Äôs exactly the gap CoinAPI fills, giving you research-ready data with full depth and precision, whether you‚Äôre testing alpha decay, fine-tuning an execution model, or prepping data for a peer-reviewed paper.

### From free APIs to serious infrastructure

**Many developers and crypto analysts begin their journey with free APIs, but they quickly run into the same barriers: incomplete historical data, rate limits, and missing granularity.** While fine for quick demos or basic dashboards, these tools fall apart when you're building anything research-grade. As one developer said after hitting API limits and data gaps: *‚ÄúI realized I needed infrastructure, not just access.‚Äù* CoinAPI fills that gap with consistent historical data, complete tick/quote/order book granularity, and a schema built for people who care about accuracy over aesthetics.

Using historical data to understand seasonality in crypto
---------------------------------------------------------

Traders and researchers alike often ask: *‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best time of year to buy or sell?‚Äù* While opinions flood forums, **real insight requires historical data across multiple years and assets.** With CoinAPI, users can analyze multi-year trends in price action, volatility, volume, and liquidity across exchanges to detect cyclical patterns or anomalies. Testing a Q4 accumulation idea or analyzing pre-halving volatility? With consistent, structured historical data, you can turn hunches into data-backed insights.

### Researchers rely on high-resolution time series

1-minute crypto data is the backbone of many backtesting frameworks, yet users constantly struggle to find complete and consistent datasets. From simple momentum strategies to more complex microstructure studies, the lack of clean 1-minute resolution (across years and exchanges) can bottleneck research before it begins. CoinAPI solves this by offering granular OHLCV datasets down to the minute, aligned across symbols and venues, exportable in structured formats ready for analysis. Whether you're building time-based entry models or volatility predictors, our datasets provide the depth and structure you need to trust your results.

### When DIY researchers turn to data

From independent developers to weekend quant enthusiasts, we see a growing trend: **users building their own tools to study crypto price behavior, whether it‚Äôs tracking Monday dips, pre-halving spikes, or post-ETF volatility.** But projects like these quickly hit a wall when the data isn‚Äôt deep, structured, or complete enough. That‚Äôs where CoinAPI comes in. We support these builders with clean, exportable datasets that allow for robust analysis by hour, day, week, or cycle, across assets and venues. Whether you're coding a price tracker or validating a behavioral hypothesis, your research deserves real data, not scraped leftovers.

Ticks, quotes, and order book snapshots: Which data do you actually need?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before pulling historical data, it‚Äôs important to understand what you're working with:

* **Tick Data**: Every individual trade (or quote) captured at the moment it occurred, complete with price, volume, and timestamp. Essential for execution analysis, microstructure modeling, and building high-frequency trading systems.
* **Quote Data**: Time-stamped bid and ask prices. Useful for analyzing spread behavior, market liquidity, and quote-driven strategies.
* **Order Book Snapshots**: Full market depth captured at regular intervals. Ideal for liquidity modeling, passive fill simulation, and stress testing.

**If you‚Äôre unsure which of these you need, we strongly recommend reading our dedicated article: [Tick Data vs. Order Book Snapshots: Which One Will Give You the Trading Edge?](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/tick-data-vs-order-book-snapshots-which-one-will-give-you-the-trading-edge)**

In that article, we break down the strengths and limitations of each format with real-world trading examples, use cases, and visuals. As we explain there:

**‚ÄúTick data gives you execution truth. Order book snapshots give you market context.‚Äù**

That clarity can help you choose the right data for your specific goal, whether it's alpha discovery, liquidity analysis, or algo training.

CoinAPI supports all three data types with full historical coverage, normalized formats, and flexible delivery.

File vs. API: Which is right for you?
-------------------------------------

We‚Äôve heard from many users who spent days downloading daily CSVs from multiple exchanges only to realize they‚Äôre missing tick-level granularity or consistent time formatting.

CoinAPI‚Äôs flat files give you complete history, millisecond-aligned and cleaned, so you can skip the prep work and start analyzing.

CoinAPI offers two primary ways to access historical crypto data, each with strengths depending on your use case:

### 1. **Flat File Downloads**

* Full historical datasets in CSV or JSON, delivered via S3 or FTP.
* Ideal for machine learning model training, long-term backtesting, and reproducible academic research.
* No rate limits or API coordination required, just grab and go.

**Full historical datasets in CSV or JSON, delivered via S3 or FTP.** [View Flat Files pricing](https://www.coinapi.io/products/flat-files/pricing).

### 2. **API Access**

* RESTful endpoints let you query data dynamically by asset, exchange, and time range. [Explore Market Data API plans.](https://www.coinapi.io/products/market-data-api/pricing)
* Best for real-time analysis, data integrations, and lightweight backtesting workflows.
* Enables automation, filtering, and scripting without needing to download massive files.

Still deciding which is best for your workflow?

Check out our in-depth guide:

[**"REST API or Flat Files? Choosing the Best Crypto Data Access Method"**](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/rest-api-or-flat-files-choosing-the-best-crypto-data-access-method)

In it, we break down:

* When flat files save you time (and cloud storage headaches)
* When the API is a better fit for production systems
* How some teams successfully combine both for hybrid workflows

This article helps you align your data access method with your technical stack and project scope.

TL;DR: Use files when you need completeness. Use the API when you need flexibility. Use both if you‚Äôre serious about speed and scale.

Time ranges, resolutions, and retention
---------------------------------------

CoinAPI offers unmatched flexibility across dimensions of time and resolution:

* **Start Dates**: Data coverage goes as far back as 2011 for key exchanges.
* **Granular Resolutions**:
  + Tick-level (microsecond resolution where available)
  + 1-minute bars
  + Hourly and daily OHLCV
* **Retention**: Data is continuously stored and updated. There‚Äôs no rolling window or expiration perfect for long-term studies or audits.

You get access to both recent and historical data, critical for machine learning training sets, anomaly detection, and strategy validation.

Data engineers and ML researchers frequently mention that most market data providers don't offer enough historical depth. Learn about our [API rate limits and quotas](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/api-rate-limits-and-quotas-coinapi-guide) to optimize your data consumption.

With CoinAPI, you get all of it: trades, quotes, order book levels, and the tools to analyze them at scale.

We often hear from quants and algo traders who say:

*‚ÄúI‚Äôve built my strategy, now I just need decent historical intraday data to backtest it.‚Äù*

But most APIs only offer daily candles or partial price feeds. That‚Äôs not enough if you‚Äôre modeling:

* Entry/exit timing
* Spread sensitivity
* Order book shifts
* Microstructure alpha

With CoinAPI, you don‚Äôt just get OHLCV, you get:

* Tick-by-tick trade logs
* High-resolution quote data
* Full L2 order book snapshots with deltas

*‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt run a realistic backtest without this kind of data. CoinAPI gave me what I needed - all the way down to the quote.‚Äù* - Independent algo trader, Germany

Common use cases by segment
---------------------------

Here‚Äôs how your team might use historical crypto data:

Quant researchers & Traders
---------------------------

Looking to simulate alpha decay or calibrate execution under pressure? CoinAPI gives quants the raw materials they need:

* Backtest intraday strategies using real tick and quote-level data
* Simulate passive and aggressive fills with full book snapshots
* Analyze how spreads and volume shifts impact execution timing

*‚ÄúOur execution models need to understand book pressure. The L2 data from CoinAPI made a big difference.‚Äù*

Academic institutions
---------------------

Publishing reproducible results in crypto finance is hard when the data is patchy. CoinAPI helps researchers focus on insights, not cleaning:

* Get labeled datasets across hundreds of assets and exchanges
* Avoid gaps, symbol mismatches, or timezone inconsistencies
* Replicate event-based studies (e.g., hard forks, exchange outages)

*‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt need to post-process; we could start modeling on day one.‚Äù*

**For detailed technical guidance on accessing different data types, explore our comprehensive guide on** [how to access tick-by-tick data and snapshot order book data from 380+ exchanges.](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/how-to-access-tick-by-tick-data-and-snapshot-order-book-data-from-380-exchanges)

ML & Data science teams
-----------------------

Training models on fragmented data leads to bad predictions. CoinAPI‚Äôs structured feeds support serious ML workflows:

* Access deep historical records with minute-level or tick granularity
* Use full quote and order book data to model liquidity, volatility, and flow
* Avoid sparsity issues with a consistent schema across exchanges

Portfolio & Risk teams
----------------------

Precision in portfolio management starts with consistent data. CoinAPI helps risk and NAV systems stay synchronized:

* Feed OHLCV into pricing engines, risk models, or dashboards
* Standardize NAV across assets and exchanges
* Run historical stress tests across multiple assets and market regimes

Infrastructure & Backend engineers
----------------------------------

Engineers want stable, scalable integration, not fire drills from exchange disconnects. CoinAPI streamlines access:

* Use one API for [hundreds of venues](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/which-exchanges-does-coinapi-cover-a-breakdown-by-asset-class), all normalized
* Avoid reconnection headaches with resilient WebSocket and REST endpoints
* Deploy flat file ingestion for batch processing and long-term storage

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

### Why does CoinAPI show higher volume than CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap?

CoinAPI includes all market types (spot, futures, perpetuals, options) while most other providers only show spot trading volume. For Bitcoin, you might see ~$35B on CoinGecko (spot only) vs ~$1.196T on CoinAPI (all markets combined). This isn't an error‚Äîit's a more complete picture of total market activity.

### What's included in CoinAPI's volume calculations?

Our volume data aggregates trading activity from:

* **SPOT trading** (traditional buy/sell)
* **PERPETUAL futures**
* **FUTURES contracts**
* **OPTIONS trading**

This comprehensive approach gives you the total trading interest across all instruments, not just a fraction of market activity.

### How do I get only spot volume data from CoinAPI?

If you need spot-only volumes to match other providers, you can:

bash# Get only spot BTC/USDT data from Binance GET /v1/ohlcv/BINANCE\_SPOT\_BTC\_USDT/history # Filter for spot-only symbols across exchanges GET /v1/symbols?filter\_symbol\_id=SPOT

### What's the difference between tick data, quotes, and order book snapshots?

* **Tick Data**: Every individual trade captured with price, volume, and timestamp. Best for execution analysis and high-frequency trading systems.
* **Quote Data**: Time-stamped bid and ask prices. Ideal for spread analysis and quote-driven strategies.
* **Order Book Snapshots**: Full market depth at regular intervals. Perfect for liquidity modeling and passive fill simulation.

### Should I use the API or download flat files for historical data?
