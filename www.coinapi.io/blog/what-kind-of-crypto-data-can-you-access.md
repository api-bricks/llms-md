Exchange rates
--------------

This is the value at which one currency can be exchanged for another. It serves as a measure of the value of one currency relative to another. By connecting with CoinAPI, you will be able to learn the exchange rating of multiple cryptocurrencies on more than 350 exchanges. The minimal latency guaranteed by the connection via our API means that this data can be used, for example, in [statistical arbitrage](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/3-statistical-arbitrage-strategies-in-crypto).

Quotes - snapshots of current trading information
-------------------------------------------------

Quotes provide trading information for assets, offering critical data for buyers and sellers to swiftly make informed decisions. Specifically, quotes display the best bid and ask prices for a particular trading pair on an exchange, serving as a **key indicator of current market conditions and the spread between buy and sell orders.** This data is also referred to as passive level 1 data.

Here are some key components of quotes in the Market Data API:

1. **Best Bid and Ask Prices** -Quotes provide information about the highest price a buyer is willing to pay (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept (ask) for a specific trading pair.
2. **Volume Information** - Along with the prices, quotes also include the volume resting on the best bid and ask. If the volume is zero, it indicates that the size is unknown.
3. **Timestamps** -Quotes include timestamps for when the quote was received by the exchange (time\_exchange) and when it was received by CoinAPI (time\_coinapi).

Order book data
---------------

An order book is a real-time updated list of buy and sell orders on a trading platform for a financial instrument (like cryptocurrencies), showing the quantity of the instrument being bid or offered at various price levels. Provides valuable clues as to whether prices are about to rise or fall.

### Order book - Level 1, Level 2, Level 3

CoinAPI delivers full-depth order book data:

1. **Level 1 (L1)** - Provides the best bid and ask prices along with their sizes. This is the most basic level of order book data and is often used for quick reference to the current market price.
2. **Level 2 (L2)** - Includes multiple price levels on both the bid and ask sides. It provides more depth than L1, showing the market depth beyond the best bid and ask prices. This level is useful for understanding the supply and demand at different price levels.
3. **Level 3 (L3)** - Offers the most granular view of the order book, including individual orders. It provides detailed information about each order, such as order ID, price, size, and the type of update (e.g., add, update, delete). This level is essential for high-frequency trading and in-depth market analysis.

OHLCV
-----

**OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) is a summary of changes in the price of a trading instrument and trading activity over a specified period.** The Open and Closed values indicate the price at which the security was first traded and the last price at the end of the period, respectively. The High and Low values represent the maximum and minimum prices during the period. The volume shows the total volume traded. OHLCV gives a detailed insight into price changes and the number of transactions that took place over a certain time. This data is available in various granularities, from 1 second to 5 years.

Whatâ€™s more?
------------

In addition to those mentioned above, CoinAPI also provides data of varying levels of detail needed to better understand the crypto market.

### Metadata

Metadata in CoinAPI provides essential information about exchanges, assets, and symbols. This includes details such as the name of the exchange, the type of asset (e.g., cryptocurrency, fiat), and the specific symbols used for trading pairs. Metadata is crucial for understanding the context of the data you are working with, ensuring that you can accurately interpret and utilize the information provided by CoinAPI. It helps in mapping and standardizing data across different exchanges, making it easier to integrate and analyze.

### Raw Data

Raw data represents the most granular level of market information available. Unlike aggregated data types, raw data captures every single market event as it happens, without any summarization or aggregation. This includes individual trades, order book updates, and quote changes. Raw data is disseminated continuously, ensuring that users have access to the most immediate and detailed market insights. This type of data is particularly valuable for custom analysis, developing unique trading algorithms, and conducting in-depth market research.

### Tick-by-Tick Data

Tick-by-tick data is a subset of raw data that provides a detailed record of every single trade and quote update in the market. **Each "tick" represents a single event, such as a trade execution or a change in the best bid or ask price.** This data is invaluable for [high-frequency trading strategies](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/high-frequency-treading-strategies-in-crypto), quantitative analysis, and backtesting trading models. CoinAPI offers access to historical tick-by-tick data through flat files, allowing users to perform comprehensive historical analysis and develop data-driven trading strategies.

Something new: crypto indexes
-----------------------------

In addition to the above data available through the Market Data API, you can now also collect information on crypto indices thanks to [Indexes API.](https://www.coinapi.io/indexes-api) Crypto indexes, such as those provided by CoinAPI, are typically calculated by **tracking a selection of cryptocurrencies based on specific criteria**, such as market capitalization. The index value is derived from the prices of the included cryptocurrencies, which are weighted according to their market cap or other factors. This allows the index to **reflect the overall performance of the cryptocurrency market or its segment.**
