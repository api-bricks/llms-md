What is CoinAPI? The Evolution of Crypto API
============================================

![featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2F0c93057de61d32a8ac40caa874e74c9787f7f4c0-1000x500.png%3Frect%3D0%2C33%2C1000%2C435%26w%3D920%26h%3D400&w=1920&q=75)

***CoinAPI is a marketplace where you can find the most advanced free [crypto API](https://www.coinapi.io/). Unlike CoinGecko [data market APIs](https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/), which are also free and provide reliable and unbiased information without the need for API keys, CoinAPI offers additional features and customization options. Moreover, it empowers users to gain the most from cryptocurrency markets. In addition, excellent documentation, customization, free crypto API, developer support, and SDK in multiple languages make CoinAPI the market‚Äôs first choice.***

Introduction to CoinAPI
-----------------------

CoinAPI is a leading provider of cryptocurrency market data and APIs, offering a comprehensive platform for developers, institutions, researchers, and more. With a focus on delivering accurate and reliable data, CoinAPI has established itself as a trusted source in the cryptocurrency industry. By providing access to a wide range of data, including market data, [trading data](https://dataproducts.coinapi.io/products/coinapi-crypto-spot-data-global-spot-markets-trades-oh-coinapi), and blockchain data, CoinAPI enables users to make informed decisions and stay ahead of the curve in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies.

Comprehensive Crypto Data Solutions with Historical Data
--------------------------------------------------------

If you‚Äôre looking for accurate and up-to-date pricing data for a variety of cryptocurrencies, get all exchanges, assets, symbols, historical data, or [EMS trading API](https://www.coinapi.io/ems-api), then be sure to check out the CoinAPI products. Crypto APIs and [cryptocurrency APIs](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/coinapis-cryptocurrency-data-api-types) are essential tools for accessing this data, automating trading, and integrating real-time market information into your applications. Whether you‚Äôre a cryptocurrency developer, trader, or just passionate about all things crypto, CoinAPI is designed to make your crypto journey smoother.

CoinAPI ‚Äì One Place, All Crypto Data and Crypto APIs You Need
-------------------------------------------------------------

CoinAPI started in 2017. Before that, the CEO of our company, Artur Pietrzyk, used CoinAPI infrastructure personally. Primarily, CoinAPI was a platform that provided a fast, reliable, and unified API to access real-time or historical [data from cryptocurrency](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/how-to-get-historical-and-real-time-crypto-data) markets. In the beginning, CoinAPI had a single API in its portfolio ‚Äì the . Today, we have 2 fundamental products in our portfolio, but this is just the beginning.

The importance of digital assets in the evolution of CoinAPI cannot be overstated. Digital assets have played a crucial role in the cryptocurrency market, influencing the development of APIs for blockchain interaction and modern payment solutions.

*‚ÄúCoinAPI was a hobby project to implement high-frequency market-making models combined with [statistical arbitrage](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/3-statistical-arbitrage-strategies-in-crypto) in cryptocurrency markets. After analyzing the market, I decided to launch the first API integrating data from multiple exchanges into one simple interface (at the time, there were about 5 exchanges). There was no other project of this type and my main problem was interacting with the exchanges, and I decided to hand over this infrastructure to people who will build other great projects on it,‚Äù said Artur Pietrzyk, CEO of CoinAPI.*

Key Features of CoinAPI
-----------------------

CoinAPI offers a range of key features that make it an ideal choice for those looking to access cryptocurrency market data. Some of the key features include:

* **Blockchain data**: CoinAPI provides access to blockchain data, enabling users to gain insights into the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies.

CoinAPI ‚Äì Mission & Vision
--------------------------

We want to move away from the perception that CoinAPI is simply a market data API. We don't want to provide such a limited service at a time when the market is booming. According to [Allied Market Research](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/crypto-currency-market), the global cryptocurrency market size was valued at $1.49 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $4.94 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 12.8% from 2021 to 2030.

The goal of CoinAPI is to create a collection of dedicated APIs for the cryptocurrency market. CoinAPI's goal is to create a one-stop shop for all customer use cases, eliminating the need to choose between different vendors on the market. All required APIs will be available in one location ‚Äì CoinAPI.

There is no better or faster tool to bridge the information delivery gap between CoinAPI and cryptocurrency trading markets when it comes to trading or automated data collection.

CoinAPI's vision is to create a marketplace with dedicated APIs to satisfy all user needs in the cryptocurrency market. CoinAPI is the most advanced API marketplace for scaling enterprise marketplace growth. Customers chose CoinAPI because of its 5 years of proven experience, strong and tested platform, service capabilities, and ability to quickly implement the platform.

Getting Started with CoinAPI
----------------------------

Getting started with CoinAPI is easy. To begin, users simply need to sign up for an account and obtain an API key. Once they have their API key, they can start accessing CoinAPI‚Äôs comprehensive cryptocurrency data. CoinAPI also offers a range of resources and support to help users get started, including documentation, tutorials, and customer support.

And Today‚Ä¶ CoinAPI has 100,000 users across the globe!
------------------------------------------------------

CoinAPI currently has two APIs in its portfolio: Market Data API and [EMS Trading](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/the-role-of-ems-trading-api-in-portfolio-management) API. We cover a wide range of use cases, such as real-time market data, historical data, trading signals, and high-speed trading. CoinAPI removes the complexity of crypto operations, trading, and data access at scale.

* **Real-World Applications of CoinAPI:**
  + Real-time market data
  + Historical data analysis
  + Trading signals generation
  + High-speed trading
  + **Exchange data**: Access to exchange data is essential for real-time analysis and decision-[making in the cryptocurrency market](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/market-making-in-crypto). Our APIs allow users to monitor exchange-specific information like asset holdings and trading volumes.

Real-World Applications of CoinAPI
----------------------------------

CoinAPI has a wide range of real-world applications, including:

* **Crypto trading**: CoinAPI‚Äôs data can be used to inform trading decisions and optimize trading strategies.
* **Market analysis**: CoinAPI‚Äôs data can be used to analyze market trends and identify opportunities.
* **Research**: CoinAPI‚Äôs data can be used to conduct research on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.
* **Development**: CoinAPI‚Äôs data can be used to build applications and services that utilize cryptocurrency market data.

Overall, CoinAPI is a powerful tool for anyone looking to access comprehensive cryptocurrency market data. With its range of features, ease of use, and real-world applications, CoinAPI is an ideal choice for developers, institutions, researchers, and more.

Why Use The CoinAPI Marketplace
-------------------------------

CoinAPI provides a complete toolkit for your cryptocurrency assets, helping in managing and securing digital assets:

1. Firstly, developers can be automatically onboarded and begin implementing APIs without having to spend time dealing with multiple APIs themselves. Before this solution, businesses had to build an abstraction layer from scratch.
2. CoinAPI has various interfaces and this is easy to access where exchanges don‚Äôt have that scope. We also have Enterprise interfaces like [FIX protocol](https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/fix/), which allow us to integrate even very small exchanges with systems that support this specific fix protocol.
3. Low latency is a critical feature in this case. The exchanges take place all over the world (US, Europe, Asia). As CoinAPI, we have servers in each of these regions. People can access our services through a gateway on each continent. Moreover, CoinAPI has redundancy, so if one of our servers in Europe fails, customers are redirected to the closest location.
4. CoinAPI enables organizations to synchronize data, collaborate more effectively, and develop new business software solutions.
5. Enabling communication between software tools and APIs enables the development of new automation methods, data collection, and enterprise software ecosystems.

### Summary

In conclusion, CoinAPI allows connecting all of the apps into a seamless interface, so this results in a highly effective stack. The integration of crypto APIs and cryptocurrency APIs is essential in automating trading, providing real-time market information, and simplifying the development of applications that interact with the blockchain.
