**Real-Time exchange rates**
----------------------------

At [CoinAPI](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/what-is-coinapi-the-evolution-of-free-cyrpto-api), our [crypto exchange rates](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/cryptocurrency-exchange-rates), a key aspect of [Market Data API](https://www.coinapi.io/market-data-api), are calculated using the 24-hour [Volume Weighted Average Price](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/vwap-volume-weighted-average-price) (VWAP-24H). This calculation is derived from a variety of high-quality data sources, with a specific focus on ‚ÄúSPOT‚Äù data types. We meticulously exclude any data from sources that are not deemed legitimate. Our approach involves a combination of quotes, trades, and metadata datasets, applying strict criteria for spreads in quotes and placing a strong emphasis on midpoint data for accurate pricing.

Trade volumes are integral to our VWAP24 algorithm, another component of CoinAPI‚Äôs cryptocurrency data API. We give utmost priority to data freshness, updating the last 24-hour volume for each symbol every 4 hours and ensuring continuous updates every second. The algorithm is further enhanced with statistical filtering and a preference for high-ranking exchanges, ensuring the provision of the highest quality data. Lastly, we utilize a tree structure based on the VWAP24 data to determine the final exchange rates, guaranteeing that our users have access to the most current and accurate exchange rates as part of CoinAPI‚Äôs cryptocurrency data API. This ensures instant access to real-time exchange rates.

---------------------------------------

CoinAPI provides detailed [order book data](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/order-book-data-in-crypto) across three levels, each offering varying insights into market dynamics:

* **Order Book Level 1 (L1):** This basic level gives a snapshot of the market, ideal for a quick overview of current conditions and high-level market dynamics.

CoinAPI‚Äôs REST API allows access to the current order book for specific symbols and their depth. Additionally, our [WebSocket API](https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/websocket/) provides real-time L2 order book data, ensuring the latest information is readily available for trading and analytical purposes. Our comprehensive cryptocurrency data API also provides detailed order book data, making it a one-stop solution for accessing extensive cryptocurrency information.

**Order Book Snapshots**
------------------------

CoinAPI offers a range of order book snapshots to suit various analytical needs, with intervals ranging from tick-by-tick to longer spans like 10ms, 100ms, 1s, and 10s. This variety allows users to choose the level of detail that best fits their trading and analysis strategies. The service includes:

These diverse snapshot options from CoinAPI provide the tools necessary for close market monitoring and analysis, ensuring users have access to the detailed data needed for informed decision-making. Additionally, crypto APIs are used to access detailed order book snapshots, enhancing the ability to quickly integrate real-time data into applications.

**Real-time order book updates**
--------------------------------

CoinAPI stands out for its ability to deliver real-time order book updates, a vital tool for market participants requiring the most current data. Each update from our platform includes comprehensive details such as the price level, the number of orders at that level, whether the orders are buy or sell, and the precise timestamp. These updates are transmitted within milliseconds, making them indispensable for trading strategies that depend on immediate market data.

Additionally, CoinAPI offers a WebSocket endpoint for seamless real-time market data streaming. This feature ensures that users have continuous access to live market dynamics, enabling them to react swiftly to market changes and maintain a competitive edge in their trading and analysis. Users benefit from instant access to real-time order book updates, providing immediate retrieval of critical market data.

**Quotes**
----------

Quotes are crucial for traders and investors who depend on current information for making informed decisions. They typically include bid and ask prices, providing a snapshot of the current market demand and supply, and are a vital tool for assessing the market. In cryptocurrency, quotes are particularly important for algorithmic trading, where accuracy and speed are essential. They also form the basis for market analysis, aiding in identifying trends and gauging market sentiment. Additionally, quotes are used as reference points for executing trades, ensuring that transactions reflect the latest market conditions. Cryptocurrency APIs are used to access real-time quotes, enabling developers to integrate up-to-date market data into their applications.

**Crypto OHLCV data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)**
------------------------------------------------------

[OHLCV data](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/understanding-ohlcv-in-market-data-analysis) is a comprehensive summary of market activity within a specific timeframe, capturing crucial market movement aspects. This data is fundamental to technical analysis, helping traders identify market trends and patterns and providing insights into market psychology and potential future movements. It‚Äôs widely used in charting for visualizing market trends, creating trading indicators like moving averages and Bollinger Bands, and backtesting trading strategies.

CoinAPI offers OHLCV updates for each symbol, with periods from 1SEC to 1MIN. Updates are sent when a period closes or every 5 seconds if the period has been updated but not closed, ensuring users have timely and accurate data for analysis and decision-making. Crypto APIs are essential for accessing OHLCV data, allowing developers to integrate real-time cryptocurrency data into their applications efficiently.

**Derivative tick Info**
------------------------

CoinAPI‚Äôs Derivative Tick Info provides essential data points for navigating the derivatives market, including:

* **Open Interest:** The total number of outstanding derivative contracts, offering insights into the market depth and trader commitment.
* **Funding Rate:** The fee exchanged in perpetual contracts, reflecting the cost of maintaining positions and the degree of market leverage.
* **Mark Price:** The fair value of a derivative contract, used primarily in margin calculations to ensure fair trading.
* **Index Price:** The current price of the underlying asset in a derivatives contract, is crucial for contract valuation.

This data is critical for participants in the derivatives market, aiding in understanding market dynamics, risk management, and assessing market health and sentiment. Traders use this information to gauge market sentiment, develop hedging strategies, and perform comprehensive risk assessments, making it an invaluable tool for informed decision-making in the dynamic world of derivatives trading. Additionally, cryptocurrency APIs are used to access derivative tick info, enabling developers to integrate this data into their applications for monitoring markets and trading operations.

**Liquidations**
----------------

Liquidations in trading occur when an exchange forcibly closes a trader‚Äôs position due to their margin balance falling below the required maintenance margin, a measure to maintain the trading system‚Äôs integrity. These events are significant indicators of market volatility and the level of risk traders are taking on. High volumes of liquidations typically suggest extreme market conditions and can signal impending shifts in market dynamics.

This data is vital for thorough market analysis, aiding in evaluating market sentiment, identifying potential reversal points, and forming part of effective risk management strategies. Understanding trends in liquidations allows traders and analysts to gain valuable insights into current market conditions, enabling them to tailor their strategies more effectively. Crypto APIs are essential for accessing liquidation data, providing real-time insights that enhance the development of crypto-related applications.

**Trade volume data**
---------------------

Trade volume data measures the total cryptocurrency traded on an exchange within a specific period, acting as a key indicator of the exchange‚Äôs liquidity and the overall activity in the market. Its significance lies in its ability to reflect market dynamics; high trade volumes often correlate with heightened market activity and can signal the strength or importance of price movements. In market analysis, trade volume data is crucial for identifying trends, confirming chart patterns, and understanding supply and demand dynamics. Both analysts and traders depend on this data for informed decision-making, as it offers essential insights into market momentum and potential future trends. Cryptocurrency APIs are used to access trade volume data, enabling developers to integrate this crucial information into their applications.

**Latest quotes data**
----------------------

CoinAPI provides the latest quote data for a broad range of cryptocurrencies, essential for [high-frequency trading and strategies](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/high-frequency-treading-strategies-in-crypto) dependent on the most recent market data. This service is crucial for real-time trading systems where quick access to current market information is key to effective decision-making. It also plays a vital role in continuous market monitoring, helping traders and analysts keep pace with fast-changing market conditions. Quick traders, in particular, find this service invaluable for its ability to offer immediate updates, allowing them to respond rapidly to market shifts.

CoinAPI ensures users receive the latest updates for any chosen cryptocurrency symbol. New quote messages are triggered with each change in the order book‚Äôs top bid or ask level, providing an up-to-the-moment market snapshot. This commitment to delivering comprehensive, timely market data is exemplified by our Order Book Level 1 Feed, designed for efficiency and speed in updating the latest market quotes. CoinAPI‚Äôs blend of speed, precision, and thoroughness makes its latest quotes data a critical tool for traders and analysts in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency market. Additionally, crypto APIs are essential for accessing the latest quotes data, enabling developers to integrate real-time cryptocurrency information into their applications seamlessly.

**Raw data**
------------

CoinAPI distinguishes between aggregated and raw data types to cater to diverse data analysis needs. Aggregated data types, such as OHLCV and Exchange Rates, require a specific period for aggregation, with our datasets starting from a minimum interval of 1 second. On the other hand, raw data types represent the pinnacle of real-time information, capturing every market nuance as it happens. This unaggregated, real-time data is disseminated continuously, ensuring that every update is promptly available. For those seeking the most granular level of market data, our historical API and flat files offer tick-by-tick data, accessible through our dedicated [Flat Files](https://www.coinapi.io/products/flat-files) service. Cryptocurrency APIs are used to access this raw data.

Providing the most detailed and granular data, raw data types are particularly valuable for custom analysis and the development of unique trading algorithms. Institutions and advanced traders leverage this data for conducting comprehensive market analysis, developing proprietary trading models, and for extensive research purposes. This level of detail and immediacy in data provision makes CoinAPI an essential resource for those requiring in-depth, real-time market insights.

**Flat files**
--------------

CoinAPI‚Äôs [Flat Files S3 API](https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/s3-api), a vital part of CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Data Types, is a RESTful interface designed for seamless access to data stored in flat file formats. This API is in line with Amazon S3 standards, offering the flexibility to integrate with existing Amazon S3-based infrastructure. While it shares similarities with Amazon S3, the Flat Files S3 API is specifically tailored for listing and downloading files, and does not cover the entire spectrum of Amazon S3 features. This specialized approach ensures that users can efficiently manage their data retrieval needs, a key aspect of utilizing CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Data Types, especially when accessing and downloading the extensive data archives provided by CoinAPI. Additionally, crypto APIs are essential tools for accessing flat files, allowing developers to quickly integrate real-time cryptocurrency data into their applications.

**Crypto index data**
---------------------

Our another product is [Indexes API](https://www.coinapi.io/indexes-api) which gives you comprehensive access to historical and real-time crypto index data. You can access more than 7k indexes and 2k assets as well as create your custom index. Indices are the proper way to research the overall cryptocurrency market performance or its segment. They are also a way to attract non-crypto investors because of the simplified and accessible investment process that doesn‚Äôt require researching and selecting individual cryptocurrencies.

CoinAPI provides crypto index data in various formats, including JSON, CSV, and XML. The data typically includes information such as the index name, timestamp, value, and other relevant metrics that are part of the index calculation. Cryptocurrency APIs are used to access this crypto index data, enabling developers to integrate it into their applications.
