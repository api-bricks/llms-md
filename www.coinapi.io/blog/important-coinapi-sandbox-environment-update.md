CoinAPI Sandbox Environment Update
==================================

![featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2F10d5a3291358930037dc19e8e74d759a7f924fb0-1200x802.png%3Frect%3D0%2C140%2C1200%2C522%26w%3D920%26h%3D400&w=1920&q=75)

***Today, we are announcing a significant change in our operations â€“ the discontinuation of the sandbox environment for all of our APIs. We recognize that this might come as unexpected news, so we want to take a moment to explain the rationale behind this decision.***

What is a Sandbox Environment?
------------------------------

A sandbox environment is a secure, isolated virtual space where software code and application environments can be executed, tested, and analyzed without impacting an organizationâ€™s network infrastructure or live applications. Different applications and programming languages create their own sandboxes to isolate and protect local resources from potentially untrusted code.

It offers a controlled environment for testing, training, and analyzing software code and application environments. This enables developers and security teams to test and analyze potentially harmful software, malicious code, and untrusted code without jeopardizing the production environment.

CoinAPI's Sandbox Environments Update â€“ Why The Change?
-------------------------------------------------------

The primary motivation behind this decision is the internal complexity that arises from managing a separate infrastructure solely for testing purposes. This has proven to be a challenging task, and we believe our resources can be better utilized to enhance and expand our core services.

**Weâ€™ve observed that most of our customers prefer to test and develop directly within our production environment. This transition is now more seamless than ever, as customers can issue additional API keys for testing purposes from our Customer Portal and apply custom limits to them.** Utilizing a sandbox for testing and development provides a secure and isolated environment, minimizing risks to live systems and safeguarding against malware. This is now the recommended approach for testing our APIs.

We are also working on expanding our plans to facilitate easier trial usage in the production environment. This will be particularly advantageous for those who previously relied on the sandbox for research and exploration before purchasing a plan. In the meantime, our free plan remains available and can be used for similar purposes. Customers can also establish their own sandbox using virtual machines or cloud platforms to ensure isolated testing and analysis without impacting the main system.

What Does This Mean for Our Customers and Software Developers?
--------------------------------------------------------------

### **Transitioning from the Sandbox to the Production Environment**

**The shift from the sandbox to the production environment is now more streamlined than ever.** With the ability to issue additional API keys for testing from our Customer Portal, you can set custom limits for them. This offers flexibility and control, making the production environment the recommended setting for all your testing needs. Additionally, you can leverage virtual environments for safe and scalable code execution and analysis.

### Easy Trial on Production Environment

But what about those whoâ€™ve used the sandbox for research and experimentation before purchasing? Donâ€™t worry, we have you covered as well. **Weâ€™re currently expanding our plans to allow for easy trial usage in the production environment.** Virtual machines also play a crucial role in providing isolated testing environments, ensuring risk-free experimentation and configuration testing across different operating systems.

Moving Forward with Software Development
----------------------------------------

We believe this change will benefit all users in the long run, making the testing process more straightforward and effective. We are here to support you throughout this transition and are excited to
