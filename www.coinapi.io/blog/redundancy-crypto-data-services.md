Redundancy - The Basis of Crypto Data Services
==============================================

![featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2F272dee8b070f9ff3298fd94e4b2328b8866a6f3f-1000x500.png%3Frect%3D0%2C33%2C1000%2C435%26w%3D920%26h%3D400&w=1920&q=75)

In a modern, technological business, one of the most important challenges is to ensure that your product keeps working. No matter whether you are upgrading your software or struggling with bugs that suddenly occurred. This is all the more difficult if you use several external technology providers, which is inevitable today. You cannot make key areas of your business solely dependent on their reliability. As an entrepreneur, you have to be like a strategist and always have a plan B. And if plan B fails, then plan C, D, and E. Therefore, when choosing a [crypto market data provider](https://www.coinapi.io/market-data-api), **always pay attention to redundancy.**

What does redundancy mean in crypto data providing?
---------------------------------------------------

In simple terms, redundancy means having extra components or servers in place so that if one part fails, another can take over without causing any interruption. Suppose you establish a connection between your app and some cryptocurrency exchanges to receive real-time data. In that case, redundancy ensures that if one server or data center fails, another can immediately take over, so there's no downtime or data loss.

Why redundancy is important
---------------------------

Take into consideration these crucial factors:

### 1. Uptime

Redundancy ensures that services remain available even if one or more components fail. This is crucial for maintaining high uptime and reliability, which are essential for financial data services where downtime can lead to significant losses.

### 2. Data integrity

Redundant systems help in preserving data integrity by ensuring that there are multiple copies of data. This minimizes the risk of data loss due to hardware failures, software bugs, or other unforeseen issues.

### 3. Disaster recovery

In the event of a catastrophic failure, redundant systems can quickly take over, ensuring that services continue to operate with minimal disruption. This is vital for business continuity.

Benefits of choosing a provider offering high redundancy
--------------------------------------------------------

The customer benefits of this choice are obvious. You gain consistent access to data and services, which is crucial for applications that rely on real-time data feeds, such as trading platforms, analytics tools, and financial applications. Knowing that the service has built-in redundancy gives you confidence in the reliability and stability of the service. Moreover, redundant systems ensure that any downtime is minimized, which is particularly important for time-sensitive applications. This helps in maintaining the performance and reliability of your application.

How redundancy works
--------------------

Reliable crypto data providers, like CoinAPI, employ multiple data centers located in different geographical regions. This diversity is crucial because:

* by having data centers closer to users in different regions, data can travel shorter distances, reducing latency and improving the speed and performance of the service.
* if a natural disaster (like an earthquake, flood, or hurricane) affects one region, automated failover mechanisms are in place so data centers in other regions can continue to operate without interruption
* different countries have different regulations regarding data storage and processing. Having data centers in multiple regions helps comply with local laws and regulations.

### Data safety

In CoinAPI, data is continuously replicated across multiple servers and data centers. This ensures that multiple copies of data are always available, reducing the risk of data loss. Additionally, we conduct regular testing and drills to ensure that redundancy mechanisms work as expected. This includes simulating failures and ensuring that systems can recover quickly.

Key Takeaways
-------------

* Redundancy in crypto data means having backup systems to ensure continuous service if one component fails.
* Main benefits of redundancy include:
  + High uptime and service availability
  + Preserved data integrity
* Customers benefit from consistent access to real-time data and minimized downtime.
* Reliable providers implement redundancy through:
  + Multiple data centers in different geographical regions
  + Continuous data replication across servers
* When choosing a crypto market data provider, prioritize those offering robust redundancy measures.
