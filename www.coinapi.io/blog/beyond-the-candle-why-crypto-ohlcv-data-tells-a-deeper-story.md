Beyond the Candle… Why Crypto OHLCV Data Tells a Deeper Story?
==============================================================

![featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2F479f9e4ed562309c9865cf6bf09465854341fc45-1000x500.png%3Frect%3D0%2C33%2C1000%2C435%26w%3D920%26h%3D400&w=1920&q=75)

Some traders treat OHLCV data like a finished product. A 15-minute candle closes and that’s it... but markets don’t move in perfect… and predictable intervals. They’re constantly changing and each trade reshapes the story… sometimes in a way that a closed candle won’t ever show! So how you look at OHLCV might directly impact your trading decisions.

**Many traders think:**

* Every period has one definitive set of values
* The data only matters when the period closes
* A closed candle is the full picture

Sounds simple right? But here’s the problem… **markets don’t care about your timeframes.**

Markets Move and Your Candles Should Too
----------------------------------------

Crypto markets don't organize themselves into our time boxes. They move trade by trade… tick-by-tick. While you're staring at a 15-minute candle forming every trade can:

* Push to a new high point
* Drop to a new low
* Change the current closing price
* Add to the volume count

A candle at minute 3 could look completely different by minute 10… and **totally flip by the close…** And each shift tells you something about market behavior.

Real-time vs. Delayed
---------------------

Currently we can see two approaches:

1. **Traditional approach**: You wait for the candle to close

✔️ Clean, structured data

❌ But… you’re always reacting to *old info*

2. **Real-time approach**: You watch the market shift in real-time

✔️ You see moves *as they happen*

❌ Requires more focus… but also gives you an advantage

For active traders, this gap isn’t just theoretical. No. It’s the difference between **catching the move and watching it happen too late.**

Most traders focus on final candles… but the real insights come from watching them form:

* A sudden volume spike early in a candle? Smart money could be making a move…
* A failed breakout before period closes? That’s resistance in action….
* A price rejection mid-candle? Market sentiment shifting in real-time…

These signals disappear if you only see the final candle.

Different Styles... and Different Needs
---------------------------------------

Your approach to crypto OHLCV data should always match your trading style:

* Scalpers - need to see candles evolve in real time. Every second counts!
* Swing traders - can work with period-close data. Timing matters… but not by the second.
* Algo traders - thrive on intra-period data. Every micro-move feeds their strategy.

**Your data should adapt to your style not the other way around.**

CoinAPI Gives You a Choice
--------------------------

Markets aren’t just a series of simple steps… they’re a constant, living flow of activity. And if you're trading crypto, you know how fast things move. Sometimes speed isn’t just an advantage. IT IS EVERYTHING.

At CoinAPI, we get that!

That’s why we push real-time OHLCV updates through our WebSocket feeds. Instead of just handing you a final number, we show you every shift, every tick, every moment… as it happens. You’re not just seeing a static snapshot when the candle closes… you’re watching the market evolve in real time.

What if you prefer traditional close data? No worries… CoinAPI delivers that too through our REST API. At the end of the day, it’s about choice: Get the full picture, or stick to the basics. The way you trade is up to you.
