==================================================================

![featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2F459c27d5e460edf90d53230d3e74992d77aba946-1000x500.png%3Frect%3D0%2C33%2C1000%2C435%26w%3D920%26h%3D400&w=1920&q=75)

[**SingAlliance**](https://sing-alliance.com/) is a platform that enables the highest level of trading expertise for the most demanding cryptocurrency investors. The company handles thousands of transactions with a special focus on security, high availability, and low latency. One of the key components of their trading strategy is their ability to manage price volatility. CoinAPI provides API for crypto investing and analysis to help SingAlliance better understand the market, which results in increased profit for its customers.

![CoinAPI Market data API for crypto investing and analysis](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2F45a16c0319acce66c4be05a8ccd02ae9e982c0a8-1024x486.png&w=1920&q=75)

Since crypto assets are dynamically developing, more and more investors are trying to diversify their portfolios with them and take advantage of some of the potential benefits of this new asset class. Platforms and tools for managing cryptocurrency assets make it possible to profit from assets without worrying about the technical aspects. Since the retail industry became aware of the disruption produced by cryptocurrencies in 2017, there have been more chances than ever for funding activities in this market. SingAlliance assists companies in investing their money in high-performing assets across exchanges as an expert in managing crypto operations.

SingAlliance was established in 2011 in Singapore and is now a stand-alone wealth management business. With offices geographically positioned in Singapore, Geneva, Hong Kong, and Dubai, SingAlliance offers high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients comprehensive financial solutions and expert guidance in addition to managing a variety of investment funds with high added value.

Today we spoke with SingAlliance CEO Thierry Beck to learn how the company uses CoinAPI to transform complex aggregated crypto data into data that clients can access.

**The challenge**
-----------------

SingAlliance seeks API for crypto investing and historical cryptocurrency data analysis to do quantitative research. They need access to REST API and that was the main selection factor to choose an API vendor. SingAlliance combines its expertise in traditional finance with intensive research into cryptocurrencies by using CoinAPI. This allows them to not just advise its customers, but also actively invest on their behalf to access this new, growing asset class.

![CoinAPI Market data API](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2Fb353a0c9f4310f699ff180edc5c9b25568193aff-1024x648.png&w=1920&q=75)

**Here are the challenges SingAlliance faced:**
-----------------------------------------------

### **1. Access to REST API**

Access to REST APIs allows it to parse useful data from several exchanges at once and build a large library and feature-rich front-end application

### **2. Lack of reliable API for crypto investing and analysis**

To do quantitative research SingAllianceâ€™s biggest problem was finding market data API with instant access to real-time and historical data on cryptocurrencies

### **3. Lack of historical cryptocurrency data**

SingAlliance wanted to team up with a provider that could offer up-to-date pricing information which is essential for those in the trading, investing, and cryptocurrency fields.

### **4. Institutional solution**

SingAlliance was looking to collaborate with like-minded professionals. The corporate entity provides the support and resources to get the most out of the solutions. Plus, with the corporate entityâ€™s backing, customers are sure that the solutions are reliable, secure, and up-to-date.

### **5. Diversified sources of prices**

SingAlliance was looking for a trustworthy place to get information about cryptocurrency prices and a relatively easy method of obtaining prices from numerous exchanges and calculating the price of individual cryptocurrencies based on other supported cryptocurrencies.

**The solution â€“ API for crypto investing and analysis**
--------------------------------------------------------

SingAlliance chose CoinAPI as its provider of cryptocurrency data because it has offered trustworthy statistics for the previous three years. With CoinAPIâ€™s API, SingAlliance can monitor real-time price movements across all major cryptocurrencies; track individual wallets; identify trends among top traders; discover unusual activity like pump and dump schemes; and even check on regulatory enforcement actions against exchanges by country.

With CoinAPI, the SingAlliance team has quick access to cryptocurrency history data and is better positioned to do quantitative analysis and offer their clients the most effective trading techniques. This makes it possible for them to manage their fund to produce long-term financial appreciation by making direct or indirect investments in a broad portfolio of reputable digital assets.

API for crypto investing and analysis
-------------------------------------

SingAlliance chose to use CoinAPI because it requires a trustworthy crypto data provider that gathers and delivers data through an API to offer the best portfolio management services and quantitative trading options.
