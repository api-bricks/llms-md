Building a crypto alerting app: How Quix and CoinAPI revolutionize real-time data processing
============================================================================================

![featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2F78710aa7405263be6309841a0d16824571a65718-1000x500.webp%3Frect%3D0%2C33%2C1000%2C435%26w%3D920%26h%3D400&w=1920&q=75)

***Today, we’re thrilled to welcome the Quix team. Firstly, they’ll share valuable insights on creating a crypto alerting app using CoinAPI. Moreover, given the recent surge in the cryptocurrency market, we’ll explore how low-code platforms like Quix enable the development of customizable currency alerting apps. Additionally, these apps can now include notifications for new coin additions, thus making them indispensable tools for businesses.***

Quix: Simplifying app development
---------------------------------

[Quix](http://quix.io) lets users build apps without coding knowledge. It stands out by making app development as easy as filling out forms and choosing from drop-down lists. Users can create a working web app in minutes. Quix also offers APIs for data integration, allowing apps to share data across platforms. Many apps are already being developed on Quix, showing its huge potential.

A Q&A with the Quix team
------------------------

Now, let’s hear from the Quix team about how they developed a currency alerting app using CoinAPI. Moreover, we’ll delve into how to create a crypto alerting app without coding.

### What exactly is Quix?

Our platform processes data as it’s created. Specifically, we utilize message brokers like Kafka and MQTT, which sets us apart from traditional data engineering platforms. As a result, users can develop, test, and deploy apps that process data in the cloud efficiently.

### What can you build with Quix?

Our platform excels at automating digital experiences with high volumes of real-time data. In particular, it’s ideal when instant action on data is crucial. Quix offers simplicity and flexibility, thus making it easy to integrate into any project. Consequently, you can build custom solutions to collect, process, and publish data in real time.

Users create pipelines by connecting components on a canvas. Each component has inputs and outputs, thereby allowing flexible connections. Subsequently, Quix runs your pipeline automatically when new data arrives in your service.

**To illustrate, you can see examples of the product in the development of a [smart stethoscope](https://quix.io/case-study-ademen-smart-stethoscope/) and [other IoT devices](https://quix.io/network-connectivity-and-resiliency/).**

### What are Quix’s mission and vision?

We strive to help developers work with streaming data using their favorite languages. Initially, we focused on Python due to its popularity in ML, AI, and general development.

Our vision involves simplifying streaming data for every organization. In recent years, the world has begun dealing with massive amounts of fast-moving data from various sources. Therefore, we aim to make this data accessible and easy to use for everyone.

### Tell us about the CoinAPI & Quix crypto price alerts app

We developed a Quix connector for CoinAPI data. This connector enables users to easily integrate CoinAPI data into Quix using their API key and chosen currency pairs.

### How does this process simplify getting data to customers?

The connector streamlines data acquisition. As a result, customers can focus on their core business instead of data collection. Once obtained, users can analyze the data or combine it with other data, such as sentiment analysis results.

### Who is this product for, and what are its benefits?

Finance professionals can leverage Quix to build solutions. Specifically, our CoinAPI connector provides easy access to currency data, thus enabling the creation of high-quality financial products.

Furthermore, the connector supports various use cases, ranging from simple hedging solutions to complex derivative instruments based on multiple currencies.

### Why did you choose CoinAPI?

CoinAPI offered the least friction to get started. Their free API key and clear documentation helped us build our solution quickly. Additionally, the CoinAPI team was very responsive and helpful throughout the process.

### What are the key aspects of currency alerting for customers?

Currency alerting keeps customers updated on prices they’re interested in. The key aspects include:

1. **Choice of currencies**
2. **Alert types (buy/sell signals or raw prices)**
3. **Customizable time frames**
4. **The Business Impact of Integrations**

### What is meant by software integration and data streaming? Is the integration required, or are there just a few exceptions?

Many companies want to integrate their existing applications with the CoinAPI platform. However, questions often arise about the meaning of software integration and data streaming, as well as whether integration is always necessary.

When we discuss integration with the CoinAPI platform, we refer to connecting two or more layers of your application. This integration allows you to utilize all services provided by our API platform within your systems without implementing them yourself. Moreover, it gives you full control over the integration method, whether through API calls or WebSockets.

Streaming enables an application to use data in real time as it becomes available. By using a streaming approach to integrate with the CoinAPI platform, Quix customers can quickly build apps and services without needing to understand the intricate details of the integration. They simply select the connector, input the required details, and deploy it.

### How can integrations help a business?

Integrating microservices like Quix and CoinAPI creates an easily maintainable architecture. Furthermore, it allows businesses to evolve their tech stack without accumulating significant tech debt.
