We will take a look into the world of gaming, as well as‚Ä¶ the adult film industry. Although, we'll still talk about coins, business, and investments.***

What are meme coins? Definition
-------------------------------

A **meme coin** is a type of cryptocurrency that is inspired by internet memes, jokes, or pop culture references. Although these coins are typically created as a form of satire or humor, they have gained significant attention and value in the crypto market due to their viral nature and community-driven promotion. Here are some key characteristics of meme coins:

### **Key characteristics of meme coins**

1. **Humorous or satirical origin**  
   Meme coins often start as jokes or parodies of other cryptocurrencies. For example, Dogecoin was created as a parody of Bitcoin, featuring the Shiba Inu dog from the ‚ÄúDoge‚Äù meme‚Äã.
2. **Community-driven**  
   The success of meme coins largely depends on the community that supports and promotes them. Consequently, this can lead to high volatility as their value is often driven by social media trends and viral marketing rather than intrinsic utility‚Äã‚Äã.
3. **High volatility**  
   Meme coins are known for their dramatic price fluctuations. Basically, their value can surge or plummet rapidly based on market sentiment and online hype‚Äã ‚Äì like when Elon Musk tweeted‚Äã about Pepe Coin firing a coin value toward the moon.
4. **Low or no fundamental utility**  
   Many meme coins don‚Äôt have significant use cases or technological advancements. They primarily rely on their viral appeal and community engagement‚Äã. However, we‚Äôll prove in this article that this doesn‚Äôt apply to all meme coins. Some promote environmental and charitable initiatives, others use the modern Play-to-Earn mechanism and some carry ground-breaking technology.
5. **Speculative Nature**  
   Investing in meme coins is highly speculative. While some investors have seen massive returns, the majority of meme coins can also lead to significant losses due to their volatile nature‚Äã.

**Important! The meme coin prices listed below are for June 2024 and are approximate.** Why so? First, because the prices of each cryptocurrency sometimes vary on different exchanges. Secondly, even if you are reading this article right after its publication, in the world of cryptocurrencies light years have passed and prices may have changed many times.

But don‚Äôt worry, because if you want, you can track live cryptocurrency prices, for example, thanks to the [Market Data API](https://www.coinapi.io/market-data-api), which we‚Äôll tell you more about at the end of this article.

Ok, now let‚Äôs go on a journey through the crazy land of meme coins!

Top meme coins
--------------

1. Dogecoin (DOGE)
------------------

Dogecoin (DOGE) was created in December 2013 by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer. Initially conceived as a joke or a ‚Äúfun‚Äù cryptocurrency, it was inspired by the popular ‚ÄúDoge‚Äù meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog. The creators aimed to create a more approachable and less serious alternative to Bitcoin. Despite its humorous origins, Dogecoin quickly developed a strong and active community. The coin gained mainstream attention, particularly due to endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk, who frequently tweeted about Dogecoin, significantly impacting its price and popularity (after the first tweet, it soared 20%).

![A tweet by Elon Musk, posted on December 20, 2020, at 10:30 AM, reads 'One word: Doge.' The tweet has received 199.2K likes, with options to reply, copy the link, and view 10.1K replies.](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2Fe028d2e50109bf7be764f4f987b06f1da0000fb1-557x238.png&w=1920&q=75)

2. Shiba Inu (SHIB)
-------------------

Shiba Inu (SHIB) was created in August 2020 by an anonymous individual or group known as ‚ÄúRyoshi.‚Äù The coin was designed as a direct competitor to Dogecoin, earning the nickname ‚ÄúDogecoin killer.‚Äù The reason behind the creation of Shiba Inu was to capitalize on the popularity of dog-themed cryptocurrencies and the growing trend of meme coins. Upon its launch, Shiba Inu quickly gained traction, driven by its community and a series of strategic marketing campaigns. The coin‚Äôs popularity surged when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin donated a significant portion of his SHIB holdings to a COVID-19 relief fund in India, and burned the remaining tokens, effectively reducing the circulating supply. The market reacted positively to these moves, leading to massive price increases and widespread adoption within the crypto community. Shiba Inu also introduced its own decentralized exchange, ShibaSwap, further enhancing its ecosystem and utility.

How to create your meme coin?
-----------------------------

Creating your meme coin is simpler than it sounds, and you don‚Äôt need to be a tech genius to do it. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

### 1. Conceptualize your meme coin

First, you need a fun and catchy concept. Think about a meme or a funny idea that resonates with people. Maybe it‚Äôs inspired by a popular meme, a quirky idea, or even a funny animal. Like a beaver.

### 2. Choose a blockchain platform

Decide where you want to launch your coin. Ethereum (ERC-20 tokens), Solana, and Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20 tokens) are popular choices because they have a lot of support and tools to make the process easier. They also provide high-speed transactions and scalability.

### 3. Create the token

You can use online tools to create your token without any deep programming knowledge:

* **TokenMint** or **CoinTool**: These websites let you create tokens with just a few clicks.
* **Ethereum and BSC**: If you‚Äôre more tech-savvy, you can write a simple smart contract using Solidity for Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain.

### 4. Set up the token parameters

Decide on the name, symbol, total supply, and decimals (how divisible your token is). For example, ‚ÄúDogeDollars‚Äù (DOGE$) with a total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens. Plan how the tokens will be distributed initially (e.g., presale, airdrop, team allocation).

### 5. Deploy the Smart Contract

* **Testnet deployment**: Test your smart contract on a testnet like Ropsten (Ethereum) or BSC Testnet.
* **Mainnet deployment**: Once you‚Äôre happy with the test, deploy your token on the mainnet. You‚Äôll need some ETH or BNB for gas fees.

### 6. Spread the word

Create a website and social media profiles to promote your coin. Engage with communities on Reddit, Twitter, and Telegram. Memes thrive on community engagement.

Start by listing your token on decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Uniswap (for Ethereum) or PancakeSwap (for BSC). As your coin gains traction, aim to list it on larger exchanges like Binance or Coinbase.

### 7. Compliance and security

Last but not least, ensure your token complies with local regulations to avoid legal issues. You can ask a reputable firm to make security audit to ensure there are no vulnerabilities.

Meme coins market data ‚Äì how to get it?
---------------------------------------

Mostly it‚Äôs simple. To get historical data, for example, for research purposes, you can use [Cryptotick](https://www.cryptotick.com/) ‚Äì market data in flat files. It‚Äôs an ideal choice for technical and non-technical users seeking comprehensive crypto historical data from all exchanges. It provides quotes, trades, OHLCV, and order book snapshots. Here are some of its key features:

* **Data format and storage**

The data is stored in compressed (gzip highest available compression level) ASCII text files in CSV format. This ensures efficient storage and easy accessibility.

* **File split methodology**

Data is organized efficiently, with each data type split into single files per symbol and trading day (UTC). This organization facilitates easy access and analysis.

* **Access and authorization**

For Amazon S3 and Google GCP bucket upload options, CryptoTick requires specific authorization settings. For Amazon S3, disable the ACL in the object ownership section and attach the provided bucket policy. When it comes to Google GCP, add the service account flat-files@coinapi.iam.gserviceaccount.com with storage admin access.

* **Sample data availability**

CryptoTick provides sample data files for various data types, allowing users to evaluate the data quality and format. These samples cover a range of data types like quotes, trades, limit book snapshots, and OHLCV data.

For both, historical and real-time data on meme coins you can also use [Market Data API](https://www.coinapi.io/market-data-api) which actively collects millions of data points, tick by tick, from over 350 cryptocurrency exchanges. This includes order books, executed transactions, quotes, and [OHLCV data](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/understanding-ohlcv-in-market-data-analysis). The data is collected using REST, WebSocket, and FIX API protocols depending on what each exchange supports. To address inconsistencies across different exchanges, our API provides [crypto data standardization](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/crypto-data-standardization-the-key-to-making-insight-based-decisions).

To start, go to the [Pricing](https://www.coinapi.io/market-data-api/pricing) section and select a plan. You are also welcome to [contact us](https://www.coinapi.io/contact-us) if you need assistance in choosing the best option for you.
