How Does CoinAPI Maximize the Effectiveness of Crypto Trading Bots?
===================================================================

![featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2F6cfb8ad728a01e789e07155852c006818f515f0b-1200x671.jpg%3Frect%3D0%2C75%2C1200%2C522%26w%3D920%26h%3D400&w=1920&q=75)

***Crypto trading bots are essential for trading in the dynamic cryptocurrency market. They need the best data for the best outcomes, though. CoinAPIâ€™s Market Data API is increasingly being used by these bots. Our [Market Data API](https://www.coinapi.io/market-data-api) gives real-time data from over 350 exchanges, helping the cryptocurrency trading bots make the best decisions. Find out why our solution might be the best way to improve your crypto trading bots.***

What are crypto trading bots?
-----------------------------

Crypto trading bots are automation tools for trading. Theyâ€™re changing the way we use digital currencies. They work non-stop, buying and selling cryptocurrencies based on pre-set rules and data input.

### How do crypto trading bots work?

Crypto trading bots work by following specific trading parameters and using different market indicators. All of that is supported by the data theyâ€™re provided with, so it is crucial to input the most accurate historical and real-time data possible. They make choices based on things like price trends, the number of orders, and timeframes. Good bots often use markers like moving averages and the relative strength index ([RSI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp)).

What are the most common issues with trading bots?
--------------------------------------------------

* **Exchange API Setup Challenges:** Hard and long process of setting up exchange API due to special needs
* **Limited Profit Opportunities:** Few chances for risk spreading and making a profit due to different market sizes across exchanges
* **Data Normalization Issues:** Lack of normalized data
* **Cost-related Earning Limits:** Earning limits due to high costs for top-quality data and advanced trading tools
* **Data Collection Time Constraints:** Collecting data takes a lot of time which could be used for improving bots and trading
* **System Growth Difficulties:** Problems with growing systems due to changing trading methods and increasing amounts of data
* **Trust Issues with Data:** Missing trustworthy real-time and past price and volume data
* **Data Organization Problems:** Data that is not well-organized, incomplete, and incorrect

Top 7 crypto trading bots platforms
-----------------------------------

New platforms for crypto trading bots are popping up all the time, but there are already some solid options out there. Soâ€¦ **What are the best crypto trading bots?**

* [**Cryptohopper**](https://www.cryptohopper.com/pl): a cloud-based platform with lots of strategies. It also has a free trial, so itâ€™s good for beginners.
* [**Coinrule**](https://coinrule.com/): a platform that has over 200 strategy templates. Itâ€™s good for both new and experienced traders.
* [**3Commas**](https://3commas.io/): a platform that lets you customize your bots. Itâ€™s easy to use, so itâ€™s good if you like to be hands-on.
* [**Unibot**](https://unibot.app/x): a bot that works through Telegram, an app you might already use. This makes it convenient to access.
* [**Gunbot**](https://www.gunbot.com/): a bot with a one-time payment model. Itâ€™s good if you plan to use it for a long time.
* [**HaasBot**](https://academy.haasonline.com/glossary/haasbot/): this bot is part of the HaasOnline trading suite. Itâ€™s good if youâ€™re technically skilled and want detailed analytical tools.
* [**Zenbot**](https://www.zenbot.gg/): an open-source platform, which means you can customize it as much as you want. Youâ€™ll need technical skills to do this, thoughâ€¦

*But thatâ€™s just our opinion. The crypto trading bot market is full of new solutions. Test as many as possible to select the right tool for you!*
