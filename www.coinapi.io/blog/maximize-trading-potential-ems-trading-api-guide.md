===============================================

![featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2Fa426fcc4c2192d76fb56da4b6c9a7566ce88ded9-1200x671.png%3Frect%3D0%2C75%2C1200%2C522%26w%3D920%26h%3D400&w=1920&q=75)

***Back in 2015, Arthur Pietrzyk, the Founder, and CEO of CoinAPI, created a unique tool known as the Market Data API initially intended for his use. It didn‚Äôt take long for him to realize that his invention filled a significant gap in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. Seeing the potential, he made a strategic decision to release the Market Data API to the public. This move paid off in a big way as today, CoinAPI can proudly claim a user base of over 3,000 active clients. And we aren‚Äôt stopping there ‚Äì we‚Äôre thrilled to unveil our latest innovation, the EMS Trading API.***

**Understanding APIs and their importance in trading**
------------------------------------------------------

APIs serve as critical behind-the-scenes operators in cryptocurrency markets. They‚Äôre indispensable for collecting data or executing trades with exchanges. They empower businesses to access a wide array of resources and real-time crypto data, instrumental in developing trading bots, conducting academic research on cryptocurrency, or learning to code with crypto data.

From monitoring market prices and wallet contents to executing and receiving transactions, cryptocurrency APIs make it all possible. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures, market players anticipate an ever-increasing range of features. We‚Äôre now witnessing the gradual integration of the cryptocurrency market into the fabric of traditional financial markets.

This evolution has given rise to essential new products and services for crypto operations, with the trading API standing as a pivotal development.

Our guide serves everyone from crypto wallet creators to digital banks, market data applications to gaming platforms, and crypto exchanges to tax and accounting services. We‚Äôve meticulously curated this guide to arm you with all the information you need to maximize the benefits of our new EMS Trading API. Our mission is to equip you with the tools to revolutionize your cryptocurrency experience, whether in trading, investing, or portfolio management.

But before we delve deeper, let‚Äôs cover some basics.

**What is EMS Trading API?**
----------------------------

What exactly is trading API and who might benefit from it? In a nutshell, EMS Trading API allows you to hook up to multiple crypto exchanges through a single account. Customers can centralize their API order routing process and get the best pricing across exchanges. Trading API allows one to interact with the trading system or, more specifically, to conduct transactions directly on the cryptocurrency exchange. This is particularly useful for traders who use algorithmic models in their trading systems, as they require real-time price updates as well as the ability to execute transactions (manually or automatically) as soon as their model generates a corresponding signal.

Trading APIs have become an essential part of the toolkit of professional cryptocurrency traders, and their appearance reflects the ecosystem‚Äôs evolution. With EMS Trading API, traders can send and receive trade orders, manage their portfolios, and access real-time market data.

Now EMS Trading API is available on CoinAPI!

**Two models: managed cloud and self-hosted**
---------------------------------------------

For customers who value privacy, we have a self-hosted option ‚Äì we then do not see the transaction.

When it comes to using CoinAPI‚Äôs EMS API, customers have the option to choose between two sales models: managed cloud and self-hosted. Each model offers unique benefits and caters to different customer preferences. In this blog post, we will explore the features and advantages of both sales models to help you make an informed decision.

### **Managed Cloud**

CoinAPI‚Äôs managed cloud sales model provides a hassle-free and convenient experience for customers. Here are the key features of the managed cloud model:

* CoinAPI manages the infrastructure and monitoring: With the managed cloud, you can rely on CoinAPI to handle all infrastructure management and monitoring aspects. This frees you from the burden of maintaining and managing the underlying technology.
* Easy installation and setup using the REST API: CoinAPI‚Äôs managed cloud model offers a seamless installation process through a user-friendly REST API. Getting started is quick and straightforward, allowing you to integrate the EMS API into your trading workflow with ease.
* Fast time to market for integration projects: By leveraging CoinAPI‚Äôs managed cloud model, you can expedite your integration projects and bring your trading strategies to market swiftly. The streamlined setup process ensures a smooth and efficient implementation.
* No requirement for a DevOps team to maintain the software: With the managed cloud model, you can eliminate the need for a dedicated DevOps team to maintain the EMS API software. CoinAPI handles software updates and maintenance, allowing you to focus on your trading strategies.
* Order flow is not sent directly to the destination: In the managed cloud model, CoinAPI acts as an intermediary between your trading activities and the destination. This provides an additional layer of security and ensures that CoinAPI remains involved in the transaction process.

![ ](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2F03f59d4a28cfbdd914578932498e63862225441a-768x429.png&w=1920&q=75)

### **Self-Hosted**

For customers who prioritize privacy and want full control over their trading activities, CoinAPI offers a self-hosted sales model. Here are the key features of the self-hosted model:

* CoinAPI provides the software while you manage the infrastructure: With the self-hosted model, CoinAPI delivers the EMS API software, and you take charge of managing the underlying infrastructure. This allows you to maintain complete control over your trading environment.
* Installation instructions provided for deployment on your infrastructure: CoinAPI offers comprehensive installation instructions to facilitate the deployment of the EMS API software on your infrastructure. These instructions guide you through the setup process, ensuring a smooth implementation.
* More complex setup with a slower time to market: Compared to the managed cloud model, the self-hosted model requires more involvement and effort in terms of setup. This may result in a slower time to market for your integration projects.
* Requires a DevOps team for maintenance: With the self-hosted model, you will need a dedicated DevOps team to manage and maintain the EMS API software. This ensures that your trading environment remains optimized and up-to-date.
* Order flow is sent directly to the destination: In the self-hosted model, CoinAPI enables direct order flow between your trading activities and the destination. This offers a level of control and optimization over latency that may be preferred by experienced traders.

Both the managed cloud and self-hosted sales models for CoinAPI‚Äôs EMS API offer distinct advantages. The managed cloud model provides a hassle-free and convenient experience, with CoinAPI managing the infrastructure and monitoring. On the other hand, the self-hosted model offers full control and privacy, allowing you to manage the infrastructure and optimize latency.

Consider your specific requirements, level of control desired, and resources available when choosing between the two sales models. Whether you prioritize ease of use or complete autonomy, CoinAPI‚Äôs EMS API has a sales model that caters to your needs.

**Why Choose EMS API?**
-----------------------

EMS API can support an unlimited number of accounts in one place. In traditional trading, each account requires resources/infrastructure, because each account requires a connection to the exchange. With EMS API we not only integrate a lot of exchanges but also the user can have a lot of accounts on the exchanges. This offer is attractive for companies that handle multiple transactions and don‚Äôt have to worry about API implementation. They get a ready-made product and don‚Äôt have to employ people and build such a solution from scratch. The most important ‚Äì they don‚Äôt spend the time to switch between accounts, and that counts a lot when trading on crypto exchanges.

* **Low latency:** We promise high-quality service with minimum delay. Creating a similar product would require significant investment in terms of time and resources.
* **Standardization:** We deliver a standardized API abstraction layer in three different protocols, eliminating the need for customers to understand and integrate with each exchange interface.
* **Protocol Versatility:** Unlike other platforms, we offer all major protocols‚ÄîREST, FIX, and WebSocket‚Äîand ensure full functionality for all.
* **Flexible Trading Management:** We provide two options for trading management‚Äîself-hosted or managed cloud‚Äîto accommodate security and privacy needs.
* **Unlimited Account Support:** Our API can handle an unlimited number of accounts, offering an excellent solution for small companies and saving them the trouble of handling API implementation.
* **Full Functionality:** We aim to support all functionalities provided by each exchange, even non-standard ones.
* **Reliable Support & Maintenance:** Our dedicated support team ensures continuous performance. Should any issues arise, we‚Äôre always on hand to help.
* **Server Redundancy:** We provide a secure and stable platform with high server redundancy to prevent any disruptions to your trading operations.

In conclusion, EMS API offers an unprecedented solution for crypto traders‚Äîsimplifying trading operations, boosting efficiency, and saving valuable time. Make the smart choice today and transform your trading experience.

**Exploring the varieties of EMS Trading API**
----------------------------------------------

The EMS Trading API caters to a broad spectrum of trading requirements by offering several variants, each with its unique set of features and functionalities. The primary three types are:

### **REST API**

Famed for its user-friendly approach, REST API offers an uncomplicated and straightforward interaction platform that resonates with traders seeking simplicity in their operations.

### **FIX API**

The Financial Information eXchange, or FIX API, is an esteemed messaging protocol ubiquitously utilized in the finance industry for the electronic communication of trade-related information. With its superior, low-latency, and high-throughput trading capabilities, FIX API is a favorite among institutional traders, catering to their need for speed and performance.

### **WebSocket API**

The WebSocket API is a two-way, real-time communication protocol that gifts traders the ability to receive instantaneous market data updates and execute trades on-the-fly. It is an ideal choice for high-frequency traders and those focusing on real-time market data analysis, enabling them to remain a step ahead in the fast-paced trading world.

The EMS Trading API empowers traders by offering them the flexibility to select the type that best suits their trading needs and preferences. While some may be drawn to the straightforwardness of the REST API, others may opt for the low-latency, high-throughput capabilities of the FIX API. Meanwhile, the WebSocket API is the go-to for traders requiring real-time market data and rapid trade execution.

In a nutshell, regardless of your trading style or needs, EMS Trading API has you covered with its diverse and efficient trading solutions.

**Getting Started with EMS Trading API**
----------------------------------------

### **Step 1: Understand What EMS API Is**

The Execution Management System (EMS) API is a software product that manages orders, executions, and exposure in an efficient, fast, cost-effective, and straightforward manner. It allows you to route orders to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges simultaneously using a simple, robust, and unified Application Programming Interface (API).

### **Step 2: Choose Your Hosting Option**

The EMS API can be used in two ways:

* Managed Cloud ‚Äì Everything is hosted on CoinAPI‚Äôs side. You manage the deployment using the REST API.
* Self-Hosted ‚Äì The software is on CoinAPI‚Äôs side, but everything else is on your side.

Choose the option that best suits your needs and capabilities.

### **Step 3: Register for an API Key**

To use the EMS API, you‚Äôll need to register for an API key on the CoinAPI.io website. This key is used to authenticate your requests.

### **Step 4: Make Your First Request**

Once you have your API key, you can start making requests to the EMS API. The exact nature of these requests will depend on what you‚Äôre trying to achieve, but they‚Äôll generally involve sending HTTP requests to the API‚Äôs endpoints.

Here‚Äôs an example of how you might send a request using Python:

```
1import requests
2
3url = "https://api.coinapi.io/v1/your_endpoint_here"  # Replace with your actual endpoint
4headers = {
5    "X-CoinAPI-Key": "your_api_key_here"  # Replace with your actual CoinAPI key
6}
7
8response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
9data = response.json()
10
11print(data)
```

Replace ‚Äú`your_endpoint_here`‚Äù with the endpoint you‚Äôre trying to access, and ‚Äú`your_api_key_here`‚Äù with your actual API key.

### **Step 5: Understand the Response**

The EMS API will return data in JSON format. You‚Äôll need to parse this data to use it in your application. The exact structure of the data will depend on the endpoint you‚Äôre accessing.

### **Step 6: Handle Errors**

If something goes wrong with your request, the EMS API will return an error message. You should write your code in such a way that it can handle these errors gracefully.

### **Step 7: Dive Deeper**

The EMS API has many features and capabilities. Once you‚Äôve mastered the basics, you can start exploring these in more depth. The [official documentation](https://docs.coinapi.io/ems-api) is a great resource for this.

Remember, working with APIs can be complex, and it‚Äôs normal to run into difficulties. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help if you need it. Good luck!
