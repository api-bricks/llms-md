Crypto API vs Stock market data API: How CoinAPI and FinFeedAPI cover all your data needs
=========================================================================================

![featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2F643aaf089733aab03da55bc8135ef0b9ad460b9e-1000x500.png%3Frect%3D0%2C33%2C1000%2C435%26w%3D920%26h%3D400&w=1920&q=75)

**CoinAPI was born in crypto, built from the ground up to handle messy, fragmented digital asset data with speed, normalization, and precision.**

**But as our client base grew, so did their scope.**

Banks, hedge funds, and quant teams who first came to us for crypto soon started asking:

*"Can we also use you for equities? For FX? For filings?"*

They didn‚Äôt want to juggle multiple providers or face a new learning curve for every asset class.

**That‚Äôs why, alongside CoinAPI‚Äôs best-in-class crypto data API, we built FinFeedAPI to deliver the same developer experience and data integrity for traditional markets: equities, FX, and SEC filings.**

This article breaks down when to use which API and why having one provider for both crypto and TradFi gives you a real infrastructure edge.

FinFeedAPI: Bridging traditional financial data with developer-friendly tools
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After solving the hardest data problems in crypto, our clients pushed us further:

*‚ÄúCan you do this for equities and FX too?‚Äù*

So we did. FinFeedAPI brings our crypto-grade infrastructure to the TradFi world because they shouldn‚Äôt be separate anymore.

FinFeedAPI brings the same clarity CoinAPI delivers for digital assets to the world of stocks, currencies, and filings. You can backtest equity strategies, model FX volatility, or analyze earnings impact across global markets with raw, reliable data, always structured, fast, and ready for building advanced financial products.

FinFeedAPI product portfolio: Advanced stock market data API and more
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Stock API: Comprehensive stock market data API
----------------------------------------------

FinFeedAPI‚Äôs [**Stock API**](https://www.finfeedapi.com/products/stock-api) delivers T+1 and real-time equity market data from 20+ major global stock exchanges, including IEX and Euronext, covering over 11,000 companies. With support for Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 order book data and nanosecond-precision timestamps, you can backtest trading strategies or monitor intraday liquidity in any listed stock. Historical data is unlimited, supporting both research and compliance use cases.

Currencies API: Live and Historical FX Data
-------------------------------------------

Access accurate, up-to-date [exchange rates API](https://www.finfeedapi.com/products/currencies-api) data for both fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. Updates occur every 100ms, with REST, WebSocket, and FIX endpoints to suit your trading or analytics platform. The API supports bid, ask, mid-market, and VWAP pricing, so you can power cross-border transactions, remittance solutions, and multi-currency financial analytics.

SEC API: Instant Access to Regulatory Filings
---------------------------------------------

With FinFeedAPI‚Äôs [SEC API](https://www.finfeedapi.com/products/sec-api), you can instantly access over 30 years of SEC filings, no scraping or delays. Search, extract, and analyze full-text documents or metadata via REST and JSON-RPC, unlocking powerful compliance, audit, and fundamental research workflows for your fintech or quant research team.

Why FinFeedAPI stands out
-------------------------

Here‚Äôs how FinFeedAPI delivers raw, institutional-grade data with the speed and precision developers demand:

CoinAPI: From trader‚Äôs frustration to industry backbone
-------------------------------------------------------

**One frustrated trader. One broken data feed. One idea that changed crypto infrastructure.**

CoinAPI wasn‚Äôt born in a boardroom; it was born on a trading desk.

In 2017, Artur Pietrzyk, a high-frequency trader turned founder, hit the same wall every serious crypto quant eventually does: fragmented, unreliable, and inconsistent exchange data. He needed precision, speed, and structure, and the market wasn‚Äôt delivering.

So he built it himself.

That internal fix became CoinAPI, now the data backbone for quant desks, hedge funds, fintechs, and exchanges worldwide. With unified schemas, tick-level granularity, and one integration layer across 380+ crypto venues, CoinAPI isn‚Äôt just a data provider. It‚Äôs the invisible engine behind high-frequency models, DeFi dashboards, and institutional execution systems.

Accessing historical crypto data with a Crypto API
--------------------------------------------------

From real-time trading to [deep historical analysis](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/how-to-access-historical-crypto-data-with-coinapi-ticks-quotes-and-order-books), CoinAPI‚Äôs product suite delivers clean, consistent crypto market data built for quants, devs, and institutions who can‚Äôt afford to guess.

CoinAPI product portfolio: The leading Crypto API suite
-------------------------------------------------------

Crypto Data API: Real-time and historical crypto market coverage
----------------------------------------------------------------

At the heart of CoinAPI is a powerful [**crypto API**](https://www.coinapi.io/products/market-data-api) that aggregates real-time and **historical crypto data** from over 380 global crypto exchanges. Developers and quant teams use our crypto data API to access normalized order books, trade data, quotes, and more, with millisecond precision. This enables instant insight, advanced analytics, and seamless integration with any trading or research workflow.

Exchange Rates API: FX and crypto cross-rates
---------------------------------------------

Get **live and** **historical [exchange rates](https://www.coinapi.io/products/exchange-rates-api)** for every major fiat and crypto pair, updated at sub-second intervals, with full [VWAP calculations](https://docs.coinapi.io/indexes-api/index-offerings/vwap-index) for accurate settlement and reporting.

Flat Files: Crypto data download for Backtesting and ML
-------------------------------------------------------

For those who need bulk access to **historical crypto data**, CoinAPI provides a robust [flat file solution](https://www.coinapi.io/products/flat-files). Instantly download years of order book snapshots, tick-by-tick trade history, and OHLCV bars in structured CSV or JSON formats. These flat files are perfect for backtesting trading strategies, training machine learning models, or conducting academic research, without the limitations or rate limits of traditional APIs.

EMS Trading API: Low-latency execution and smart order routing
--------------------------------------------------------------

The [**EMS Trading API**](https://www.coinapi.io/products/ems-api) is built for high-frequency and institutional trading. With ultra-low-latency connectivity and advanced order management, you can execute trades programmatically across multiple crypto venues. Features include smart order routing, real-time risk management, and integration with both the **crypto API** and **exchange rates API** for up-to-date market conditions during execution.

Exchange Link: Unified exchange integration for reliable market data
--------------------------------------------------------------------

[**Exchange Link**](https://www.coinapi.io/products/exchange-link) connects your infrastructure directly to native exchange APIs using CoinAPI‚Äôs unified interface. This product ensures the fastest possible access to real-time data and deep liquidity while eliminating the headaches of integrating and maintaining dozens of separate APIs. Developers and infrastructure teams can easily ingest normalized market data, order books, and trade feeds from any supported exchange, all through a single connection.

Index API: Crypto benchmarks for advanced strategies
----------------------------------------------------

Access leading **index API** endpoints for crypto indices, NAV benchmarks, and sector analytics, designed for quant funds, portfolio managers, and DeFi analysts.

Why CoinAPI stands out
----------------------

![ ](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2Fc9fcae5e4d720465937ac8caeec5074109370cfd-1592x1330.png&w=1920&q=75)

What makes CoinAPI + FinFeedAPI unique
--------------------------------------

There are many data providers in the market. But **very few bridge the gap between traditional finance and crypto** the way CoinAPI does.

While most vendors specialize in one asset class, CoinAPI offers a unified approach:

* We provide **crypto-native infrastructure** that handles real-time volatility and decentralized liquidity.
* We also connect to **FinFeedAPI**, allowing clients to pull regulated FX, equity, and benchmark data within the same architecture.
* You get **one support team** and a platform built to evolve with hybrid portfolios.

This dual approach is rare, yet powerful. It means you stop choosing between crypto-native speed and TradFi-grade compliance. You get both.

And here's the key: CoinAPI didn‚Äôt stumble into TradFi, we earned our way in.

After years of solving the hardest problem in crypto, like **clean, consistent, high-resolution data across hundreds of volatile, fragmented exchanges,** we built an infrastructure that many said was impossible.

That same commitment to accuracy, speed, and reliability now powers our move into traditional finance.

If we can normalize decentralized chaos, we can definitely handle equities and FX.

CoinAPI and FinFeedAPI - Crypto API, Stock Market Data API, and More: Key Features and Benefits
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![ ](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2Fb6fec802520724e43781588dfa701179fe36eead-1270x1236.png&w=1920&q=75)

When to use CoinAPI
-------------------

You should reach for CoinAPI when:

* You need **real-time or historical tick-level data** across crypto assets
* You‚Äôre modeling **order book dynamics** (L2/L3) for slippage, latency, or spread analysis
* You require **data normalization across exchanges** to avoid mismatched symbols, timestamps, and formats
* Your research or trading systems must monitor **stablecoin flows**, **DeFi activity**, or **cross-exchange arbitrage**
* You want **WebSocket access**, bulk flat files, and schema-stable APIs that scale with your infrastructure

**For a deeper dive into when to use snapshots versus tick data**, [explore our detailed comparison here.](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/tick-data-vs-order-book-snapshots-which-one-will-give-you-the-trading-edge)

**If you need traditional OHLCV bars for your analysis,** [read our practical guide to OHLCV data.](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/ohlcv-data-explained-a-practical-guide-for-traders-and-quants)

**Not sure how L1, L2, and L3 order book data compare?** [Check out our guide to understanding market depth levels.](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/level-1-vs-level-2-vs-level-3-market-data-how-to-read-the-crypto-order-book)

When to use FinFeedAPI
----------------------

FinFeedAPI remains the right choice for:

* **Equity and bond market data** sourced from centralized, regulated exchanges
* **FX spot rates**, forwards, and historical conversion pricing
* Access to **corporate actions**, dividend histories, and official **benchmark indices**
* Generating **end-of-day valuations** for traditional portfolios
* Meeting **regulatory or compliance** requirements in TradFi contexts

If your focus is on mutual funds, ETFs, or macroeconomic modeling across fiat currencies, FinFeedAPI or a Bloomberg-like platform is better suited.

### **How to integrate both APIs in a cross-asset dashboard?**

Suppose you‚Äôre building a trading dashboard or analytics platform that needs to show *crypto order book data* (from CoinAPI) alongside *equities or FX pricing* (from FinFeedAPI). Most APIs treat these asset classes as totally separate worlds, forcing you to learn different query formats, handle different error codes, and merge results manually.

**How the CoinAPI + FinFeedAPI Approach Helps:**

Both APIs are designed to work side-by-side with a unified developer experience, the same authentication, similar REST endpoints, and harmonized documentation. For example:

* **Integration Flow:** You can authenticate and call both APIs from the same backend, with similar endpoints (e.g., `/orderbook` for crypto, `/equities/orderbook` for stocks).
* **Consistent data fields:** Order book depth, trade history, and metadata use consistent field names and formats across asset classes, so your frontend code can render them with minimal conditional logic.
* **Universal asset mapping:** Ticker and symbol identifiers are mapped across APIs, allowing you to join a crypto trading pair with a related ETF or FX rate, all in one dashboard.

**Use Case:**

A quant hedge fund might track BTC/USDT order book pressure on Binance (via CoinAPI) alongside EUR/USD FX volatility (via FinFeedAPI) and S&P 500 index pricing, all feeding into a unified dashboard for correlation analysis and risk management.

What our clients are actually doing
-----------------------------------

Hybrid use is the norm.

*‚ÄúWe use CoinAPI for real-time crypto execution and market microstructure modeling, and FinFeedAPI for FX rates and benchmark indices in reporting.‚Äù*

Examples from our users:

* Quant desks use **CoinAPI** for tick-level backtests and **FinFeedAPI** for FX conversion at settlement
* Fintech apps integrate **CoinAPI** for crypto charts and alerts, while using **FinFeedAPI** for fiat pricing
* Hedge funds model DeFi volatility with CoinAPI, but calculate NAV with FinFeedAPI inputs

**Why this matters more than ever**

As more institutions build products across TradFi and crypto, clean data is no longer optional. Picking the wrong feed for the wrong task results in:

* Mismatched timestamps and delayed signals
* Invalid backtests from improperly modeled slippage or latency
* Compliance issues due to format or pricing inconsistencies

CoinAPI is designed **natively for crypto**. It's not a repurposed TradFi feed with token wrappers; it's built for 24/7 markets, liquidity fragmentation, and high-frequency needs.

TL;DR: Know what you're modeling
--------------------------------

With CoinAPI, accessing tick-by-tick and snapshot order book data from 380+ exchanges is effortless. Whether you‚Äôre building trading algos, visualizing liquidity, or running analytics, the unified endpoints, rich docs, and scalable infrastructure give you everything you need.
