Why MarketDraft chose CoinAPI
-----------------------------

To begin with, MarketDraft needed up-to-date information on crypto prices. Additionally, they were looking for a service with a comprehensive, constantly updated database of cryptocurrencies.

A Chat with the Boss
--------------------

We recently had the opportunity to speak with Chris A. Tovmasian, the CEO of MarketDraft. During our conversation, he explained how they leverage CoinAPI to access real-time crypto prices. Consequently, this data powers their state-of-the-art simulation tools and contests.

The Problems MarketDraft Solved
-------------------------------

Before using CoinAPI, MarketDraft faced some challenges:

1. Primarily, insufficient data from different crypto exchanges
2. Secondly, a lack of trustworthy crypto information sources
3. Thirdly, an absence of real-time data for their simulation tools
4. Lastly, difficulty in finding consolidated price information across markets

![Quote on purple background praising CoinAPI as the best choice due to coverage of multiple exchanges and the trust and reliability of their brand.](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2F5a2810a453bd5d63934a3011bf58d59bc7f70d8f-1024x360.png&w=1920&q=75)

How CoinAPI Helped
------------------

Fortunately, CoinAPI addressed these issues by providing:

1. Access to lots of crypto price data
2. A reliable source of information
3. Real-time updates for MarketDraftâ€™s tools
4. Multiple price sources in one place

As a result of this collaboration, MarketDraft can now offer a highly realistic crypto environment. Therefore, users can practice buying and selling, watching their virtual investments grow just like real ones.
