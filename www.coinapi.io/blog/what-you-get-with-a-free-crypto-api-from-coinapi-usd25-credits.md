*"CoinAPI does what a good crypto API is supposed to do: quickly and easily provide live data on any cryptocurrency and their trading volume. We use CoinAPI to power our tax calculation,"* Bitcoin.tax CEO Colin Mackie

### Whatâ€™s included in your $25 Free crypto API credits from CoinAPI?

Access to CoinAPI's cryptocurrency API endpoints for testing and development - you get full PAYG (Pay-As-You-Go) account access with $25 in credits to explore.

* **$25 in free cryptocurrency API credits** to explore over 370 exchanges and 15,000+ crypto assets before committing to additional purchases.
* **A verified payment method is required** to activate your free credits (no charges unless you purchase or upgrade). You'll need to generate an API key and then add a payment method, purchase credits, or buy a subscription to unlock the credits.
* **Full API access:** With your $25 credits, you have access to the same endpoints and data quality as any PAYG account holder.
* Track usage easily in the customer portal or via API headers to manage your crypto API balance.
* **Credits never expire:** Your $25 in credits remain available on your account until you use them - there's no expiration date.

### Which endpoints are included in your $25 free crypto API credits from CoinAPI?

With your $25 credits, you can explore and test CoinAPI's full range of REST endpoints and even **test WebSocket streaming**. Each request simply deducts from your available credits. This lets you try real-world crypto data workflows and validate your use case before any commitment.

**Market data endpoints:**

* `/v1/exchangerate`: Get current or historical exchange rates for crypto and fiat assets. *Example:* `GET <https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC/USD?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY`> returns the current BTC/USD rate. For historical data, add `time_start` and `period_id` (e.g., 1HRS).
* `/v1/ohlcv`: Access OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for market analysis. *Example:* `GET <https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/ohlcv/BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD/history?period_id=1DAY&time_start=2025-06-01T00:00:00&limit=100`>.
* `/v1/trades`: Retrieve historical trade data for specific trading pairs. *Example:* `GET <https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/trades/BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD/history?time_start=2025-06-01T00:00:00`>.
* `/v1/quotes`: Fetch historical quote data (bid/ask prices). *Example:* `GET <https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/quotes/BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD/history?time_start=2025-06-01T00:00:00`>.

**Metadata endpoints:**

* `/v1/assets`: List available crypto and fiat assets. *Example:* `GET <https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/assets?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY`>.
* `/v1/symbols`: Get trading pairs and exchange details. *Example:* `GET <https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/symbols?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY`>.

### Sample responses

To help you understand the data format, hereâ€™s a sample JSON response for an OHLCV request:

```
1json
2
3[
4  {
5    "time_period_start": "2025-06-01T00:00:00.0000000Z",
6    "time_period_end": "2025-06-01T01:00:00.0000000Z",
7    "price_open": 60000.00,
8    "price_high": 60500.00,
9    "price_low": 59800.00,
10    "price_close": 60250.00,
11    "volume_traded": 150.5,
12    "trades_count": 120
13  }
14]
15
```

Sample response for an exchange rate request (`/v1/exchangerate`):

```
1json
2
3{
4  "asset_id_base": "BTC",
5  "asset_id_quote": "USD",
6  "rate": 65000.00,
7  "time": "2025-06-01T00:00:00.0000000Z"
8}
```

Quick-reference table: Free crypto API vs. Paid plans
-----------------------------------------------------

![ ](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2Fbcc9828e3cd9a25f91b7f978c18aeb1e8f209555-1042x662.png&w=1920&q=75)

Check the exact scope at /v1/assets and /v1/symbols during the trial.

### $25 credits - What you should know

* **Usage-based billing:** Your credits are consumed based on API usage - different endpoints have different costs per request.
* **Data Scope:** You have access to the full dataset, with costs per request varying (e.g., setting limit=1000 uses more credits than limit=10).
* **WebSocket Available:** You can test WebSocket streaming endpoints with your credits.
* **No Expiration:** Credits remain on your account until used - **they never expire.**
* **PAYG Account:** You're not on a "free tier" - you have a full Pay-As-You-Go account with $25 in credits to get started.

These credits give you full access to test the most important features and workflows for your use case. Make sure to plan your evaluation and prioritize the endpoints that matter most to you. If you need more credits, you can purchase them at any time to continue with the same account and integration.

How to test data efficiently
----------------------------

To get the most out of your $25 credits, use these steps to evaluate both historical and current crypto data with CoinAPI's REST API. For best results, test your calls in a sandbox or local development environment to optimize your credit usage.

**1. Understand Historical Data Endpoints**   
  
Main Endpoint: Use `/v1/ohlcv` for OHLCV data, perfect for analyzing price trends. *Example:* `GET <https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/ohlcv/BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD/history?period_id=1DAY&time_start=2025-06-01T00:00:00`>. Exchange Rates: Use `/v1/exchangerate` for historical prices. *Example:* `GET <https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC/USD/history?period_id=1HRS&time_start=2025-06-01T00:00:00`>.

**2. Optimize API Requests**

* Use the `limit` parameter (up to 100,000 data points) to fetch more data in one call.
* Filter by exchange and pair using `/v1/symbols` to avoid unnecessary data.
* Request data in CSV for lighter responses.

**3. Monitor Your Usage**

* Track limits via headers and `/api/subscriptions/usage/rest/history`.
* Cache data locally to minimize repeat requests.

**4. Test Real-time Features**

* Try WebSocket connections to evaluate streaming data quality and latency.

**Tip:** Before running large queries, test your API calls with small `limit` values and a few assets or trading pairs. This will help you avoid unexpected credit consumption.

Would you like this version inserted into your document, or do you want any further customization for your target audience (e.g., focusing on quants, fintech, or developers)?

Sample workflow: Test BTC/USD OHLCV data
----------------------------------------

1. **Confirm the trading pair exists:** `GET /v1/symbols?filter_symbol_id=BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD`
2. **Fetch 1 day of hourly OHLCV data:** `GET /v1/ohlcv/BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD/history?period_id=1HRS&time_start=2025-06-01T00:00:00&time_end=2025-06-02T00:00:00`
3. **Save to CSV with Python:**

```
1python
2
3import requests
4import pandas as pd
5url = "https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/ohlcv/BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD/history?period_id=1HRS&time_start=2025-06-01T00:00:00&time_end=2025-06-02T00:00:00"
6headers = {"X-CoinAPI-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
7response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
8data = response.json()
9df = pd.DataFrame(data)
10df.to_csv("btc_usd_historical.csv", index=False)
```

1. **Visualize trends in Jupyter Notebook or Excel.**

```
1python
2
3import pandas as pd
4import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
5df = pd.read_csv("btc_usd_historical.csv")
6df["time_period_start"] = pd.to_datetime(df["time_period_start"])
7df.plot(x="time_period_start", y="price_close", title="BTC/USD Closing Prices")
8plt.show()
```

Tip: To test multiple pairs, loop through the symbols retrieved from `/v1/symbols`.

Lightning-fast developer onboarding
-----------------------------------

With extensive [API documentation](https://docs.coinapi.io/) and client libraries for popular languages, most developers make their first successful API call in under 5 minutes. Rapid prototyping and scalable integration, no longer a setup or learning curve.

Crypto API pricing: When should you upgrade?
--------------------------------------------

While your $25 in free crypto API credits lets you test real endpoints and evaluate CoinAPI, you may need additional credits for extended testing, larger datasets, or production use.

CoinAPI offers flexible PAYG pricing where you simply add credits as needed, with no subscription required.

See our [**crypto API pricing page**](https://www.coinapi.io/products/market-data-api/pricing) to understand credit costs per endpoint and decide when adding more credits makes sense for your business.
