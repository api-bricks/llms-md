Metrics API V2: Trading Volume Analysis and On-Chain Metrics
============================================================

![featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2Fe7526651c2ce24101581e90a5982c62bb1b84f18-1000x500.png%3Frect%3D0%2C33%2C1000%2C435%26w%3D920%26h%3D400&w=1920&q=75)

**Billions are flowing through DeFi. Stablecoins are moving across chains at record speed. But most crypto market data providers still only show you what's happening on exchanges.**

That changes now.

**CoinAPI's new [Metrics API V2](https://docs.coinapi.io/market-data/rest-api/metricsv2/) opens up the $200B+ on-chain economy, giving you real-time visibility into trading volume analysis, bid-ask spread data, DeFi protocols, stablecoin activity, and cross-chain flows.**

If you're still flying blind to what's locked, minted, bridged, or earning yield, you won't be for long.

Why Complete Crypto Market Data Is Essential Now
------------------------------------------------

The crypto market has reached an inflection point. While $2.8 trillion trades daily on centralized exchanges requiring sophisticated **trading volume analysis**, over $200 billion sits locked in DeFi protocols generating yield, providing liquidity, and facilitating trades that never touch traditional exchanges.

Traditional market data APIs are like trying to understand New York's economy by only watching the stock exchange - you're missing the massive economy happening everywhere else.

**The result?** Incomplete risk assessments, missed arbitrage opportunities, and trading strategies based on half the available **crypto market data**.

What's New in Metrics API V2: Beyond Traditional Trading Volume Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Comprehensive Crypto Market Data Coverage

While our Market Data API shows you **trading volume analysis** across 380+ exchanges with real-time **bid-ask spread** monitoring, Metrics API V2 reveals the underlying blockchain economy with **sub-30 second data updates** and **99.9% uptime reliability**:
