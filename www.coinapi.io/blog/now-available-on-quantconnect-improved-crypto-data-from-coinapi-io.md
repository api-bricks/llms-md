QuantConnect integrates CoinAPI for enhanced crypto trading data
================================================================

***QuantConnect, the leading algorithmic trading platform, has teamed up with CoinAPI to revolutionize cryptocurrency trading. This powerful partnership brings high-quality, daily-updated crypto data to traders. As a result, users can create more accurate strategies and gain better market insights. Furthermore, QuantConnect users can now leverage CoinAPI‚Äôs comprehensive data from hundreds of exchanges worldwide, thus opening up new possibilities for crypto algorithmic trading.***

QuantConnect partners with CoinAPI
----------------------------------

We‚Äôre thrilled to announce our new collaboration with [CoinAPI.io](https://www.coinapi.io/). Together, we‚Äôre bringing comprehensive cryptocurrency data to our platform. Starting immediately, our users can access reliable, high-resolution data. Moreover, we‚Äôll update this data daily, ensuring you always have the latest information at your fingertips.

The growing crypto market opportunity
-------------------------------------

As the crypto markets continue to mature, opportunities for our community expand. Consequently, we‚Äôre committed to equipping our users with the best resources. These tools will empower you to build, backtest, and deploy algorithmic trading strategies that include crypto assets.

### CoinAPI: a leader in cryptocurrency data

CoinAPI enables us to deliver on this commitment effectively. They actively collect data from hundreds of exchanges worldwide. As a result, CoinAPI has earned a stellar reputation for data quality and supply. Additionally, the industry widely recognizes their engineering excellence.

### Integration benefits for QuantConnect users

We‚Äôre excited to introduce CoinAPI‚Äôs solutions to our users. Now, when you deploy a live algorithm, you have more options. You can choose either the QuantConnect live data feed or the CoinAPI integration. Best of all, you can easily access CoinAPI by simply plugging in your key.

### Advantages for existing CoinAPI customers

Current CoinAPI users will also reap benefits from this partnership. They can now leverage the LEAN platform with their existing data. Subsequently, this integration opens up new possibilities for strategy development and testing.

Artur Pietrzyk, CEO of CoinAPI, commented on the partnership:

> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre delighted to announce the availability of our data on the QuantConnect LEAN platform. This integration extends our data‚Äôs usage for backtesting and real-time trading. Currently, many of our customers perform these activities internally. However, they can now build on LEAN‚Äôs open-source platform instead. Consequently, this will enhance their experience and increase their ROI.‚Äù

QuantConnect‚Äôs commitment to algorithmic trading
------------------------------------------------

Our goal is to help you create high-performing algorithmic trading strategies. We strive to incorporate the best quantitative research techniques into our product. With CoinAPI, we‚Äôre now even better equipped to achieve this goal.
