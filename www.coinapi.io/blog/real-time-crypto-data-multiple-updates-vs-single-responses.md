Real-Time Crypto Data: Why Multiple Updates Beat Single Responses (And How to Handle Both)
==========================================================================================

![featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2F484c7482b37fc0ee8fd4cb0f88ad4429535135fc-1000x500.png%3Frect%3D0%2C33%2C1000%2C435%26w%3D920%26h%3D400&w=1920&q=75)

Granular market data is the lifeblood of modern crypto trading. Without a clear, real-time view of the order book, down to every insert, cancel, and trade, your research, backtests, and trading signals are built on guesswork. Yet for most traders and quants, getting reliable, tick-by-tick order book data is still the hardest part of the job.

Anyone who‚Äôs tried to stitch together data from multiple exchange APIs knows the struggle: missing events, mismatched formats, and endless hours lost to cleanup. Most ‚Äúcrypto APIs‚Äù only provide partial trade prints or aggregated snapshots, leaving serious professionals without the full sequence of order book events they actually need.

**This article breaks down what truly matters when working with order book data, showing you the difference between tick-by-tick and snapshots, the pitfalls to avoid, and how to make smarter choices for research, trading, or building your next product. Read on to make sure your data edge is real, not just a headline.**

Tick by tick data vs Snapshot order book data: What‚Äôs the difference?
=====================================================================

**Tick-by-tick order book data** captures every individual event that changes the order book, including new orders, cancellations, trades, and price or size updates, recorded in precise sequence. This type of granular data is essential for:

* Backtesting and validating trading strategies
* Studying market microstructure and order flow dynamics
* Detecting patterns of manipulative behavior (such as spoofing)

**Snapshot order book data** provides a complete ‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù or picture of the order book at a specific moment, typically showing the top N bid and ask levels (for example, the top 20 prices on each side). Order book snapshots are ideal for:

* Monitoring current market liquidity in real time
* Visualizing the full depth of the market at key intervals
* Supplying trading bots or analytics dashboards with up-to-date market states

Tick-by-tick data delivers every order book event as it happens, while snapshot data gives you the state of the order book at specific timestamps. Choose tick-by-tick for detailed research and backtesting, and snapshots for real-time monitoring and trading applications.

When should you use snapshots vs. Tick by tick data?
----------------------------------------------------

* Snapshots are *far* less storage- and bandwidth-intensive, making them useful for long-term studies or lightweight dashboards.
* However, they **miss** all the microstructure that happens between snapshots:
  + Order book flickers, spoofing, and fast-moving quote changes
  + Precise timing of liquidity appearing/disappearing

If you want to model slippage, simulate HFT strategies, or analyze queue dynamics, you‚Äôll need the full tick-by-tick order book feed. But for trend analysis, liquidity heatmaps, or broad research, 1-minute snapshots are often the perfect balance.‚Äù

**Snapshots vs. Tick by tick data**
-----------------------------------

![Snapshots vs. Tick by tick data](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2F7ae6b70eb1a4befc4c54e0cf68a24569a91c67a1-844x402.png&w=1920&q=75)

**Where Snapshots shine and where they don‚Äôt**
----------------------------------------------

* Snapshots are great for:
  + Liquidity modeling over time
  + Historical research on depth/imbalance
  + Long-term studies, heatmaps, and risk dashboards
* But not for:
  + Backtesting exact fills
  + Studying rapid market events or manipulative order flow

How to use each data type?

* Use snapshots for:
  + Macro liquidity studies
  + Long-term trends
  + Low-frequency trading models
* Use tick-by-tick for:
  + Fill simulation
  + High-frequency or microstructure research
  + Slippage/queue analysis

**Why snapshots matter (and when they don‚Äôt)**
----------------------------------------------

* Snapshots are useful for:
  + Initializing a local order book in your application
  + Visualizing the depth at a point in time
  + Research or audits that require a state at a known timestamp
* But they **cannot** capture *how* the book evolved between snapshots‚Äîthat requires an event (tick) stream.

Order book snapshots are perfect for seeing ‚Äòwhere the market is right now‚Äô‚Äîcrucial for dashboards, liquidity analysis, or risk checks. However, to reconstruct market moves or simulate execution slippage, you need the event-by-event stream provided by tick-by-tick data.

**What is the difference between tick data and aggregated data?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tick data records every individual trade or order book event exactly as it happens, with millisecond or better precision. In contrast, aggregated data (such as 1-second bars) summarizes price and volume over fixed intervals, losing the fine details of market activity. True tick data gives you the full sequence of events needed for research and backtesting, while aggregated data is less precise and cannot capture microstructure, slippage, or real execution dynamics.

**Aggregated data is useful, but not for serious backtesting**
--------------------------------------------------------------

Aggregated 1-second bars are fine for simple charting or strategies, but useless for high-frequency or execution simulation. If you want to test execution or build a trading bot, you need the *full* tick stream, not just summary stats.

**Aggregated data vs. Tick by tick data**
-----------------------------------------

![Aggregated data vs. Tick by tick data](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2F1fd54f2cbb16ff5a6fc6b62a0f110a3c950d8fc5-844x474.png&w=1920&q=75)

**Widespread confusion: Tick by tick data vs Level 2 data**
-----------------------------------------------------------

Many traders mix up tick-by-tick, Level 2, and order book data. In reality, tick-by-tick usually refers to every individual trade or every order book update (each ‚Äòtick‚Äô in the data), while Level 2 refers to the visible ladder of resting limit orders beyond the best bid and ask. Level 2 does not always include every micro-event or trade tick, especially in crypto, where exchange data offerings differ.‚Äù

Level 2 is typically the aggregated order book, showing multiple bids/asks at different price levels (not just the top-of-book). Tick-by-tick (in equities/forex/crypto) is every individual trade (or sometimes every order book event, depending on the vendor/API). Level 2 can *help* you infer liquidity and trading interest, but it‚Äôs not the same as having every raw tick.

**Order book data is even harder than trade data**
--------------------------------------------------

Most exchanges only offer trade history, not full order book event deltas or snapshots. Users want true L2/L3 data (not just top-of-book or occasional snapshots). While exchanges like Bybit might let you fetch recent trades, true order book history, every insert, cancel, and change, is rarely available natively. CoinAPI delivers normalized, millisecond-precise order book event streams and snapshots for hundreds of venues, including Bybit.‚Äù

**Pitfalls and pain points with tick by tick data**
---------------------------------------------------

Multiple users share experiences that tick data from different vendors often **does not match,** either in trade count, timestamp, or sequencing. Some find that even ‚Äúofficial‚Äù vendor feeds have **missing ticks**, small timing discrepancies, or different ways of handling corrections and cancellations.

* ‚ÄúLots of ‚Äòcrypto APIs‚Äô don‚Äôt really offer tick-by-tick.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre often paying for aggregated, incomplete, or messy data.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúEven if you get L2, you have to do a ton of cleanup and reconciliation.‚Äù

Gaps, mismatched timestamps, and missing micro-events can skew your results or make your research non-reproducible. This is why CoinAPI invests so heavily in precise normalization, millisecond-level timestamps, and audit-ready completeness across all feeds.

**Free APIs fall short; professional data is worth paying for**
---------------------------------------------------------------

The quant community is clear: *there‚Äôs no free lunch for tick-by-tick historical data.* Free APIs may sound tempting, but they rarely offer the depth, precision, or reliability needed for serious research or trading. DIY solutions often lead to missing events, mismatched symbols, and endless hours of data cleanup, leaving your backtests fragile and results unreliable.

Serious traders and institutions don‚Äôt gamble on incomplete data‚Äîthey invest in trusted, well-documented feeds with normalized schemas and full historical depth. The real challenge isn‚Äôt just finding tick data, but making it actionable. That‚Äôs why professionals turn to vendors like CoinAPI for research-grade, ready-to-use data that lets them skip the headaches and get straight to building strategies that work.

**Everyone wants depth, but most providers only give surface-level data**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most APIs and free tools only provide *spot prices*, aggregated candles, or incomplete trade feeds. Several users explicitly mention that *order book deltas*, micro-events, and full tick data for the top 100 coins *across multiple venues* is either unavailable or paywalled. Serious researchers and quants aren‚Äôt satisfied with just top-of-book or aggregated candles. They‚Äôre seeking true tick-level and order book event data for the top 100 coins, across multiple exchanges‚Äîsomething most APIs don‚Äôt deliver. CoinAPI answers that need, with normalized, research-grade event streams and flat files spanning 370+ venues.‚Äù

**Tick by tick data is a storage & engineering challenge, not just an API problem**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quant engineers point out that having terabytes of tick data isn‚Äôt helpful if you can‚Äôt efficiently search, compress, or transform it for your strategy. That‚Äôs why CoinAPI offers both normalized flat files for bulk download (ready for local or cloud storage) and API endpoints for dynamic queries, so you spend less time on ETL and more time modeling.

Raw tick data is *enormous;* even a single month for an active symbol can be tens or hundreds of GB. Institutions and serious quants rarely ‚Äújust pull from the API,‚Äù they download, clean, compress, and warehouse data, often in time-series databases or custom flat files.

**Data format & normalization are recurring nightmares**
--------------------------------------------------------

Managing historical tick data from multiple exchanges usually means wrangling dozens of formats and fixing broken symbols‚Äîone of the biggest time sinks in quant engineering, according to r/algotrading. CoinAPI‚Äôs plug-and-play flat files and streaming APIs are fully normalized: you get consistent schemas, unified timestamps, and clear asset mappings, no matter the source.‚Äù

**Users want more than just price; they want the f*ull story***
---------------------------------------------------------------

**What Actually Matters to Real Traders?**

* *Timestamp precision* (millisecond-level)
* *Schema consistency* across exchanges
* *Downloadable, reproducible files* for backtesting
* *Support* for troubleshooting data issues

Users are *specifically* seeking APIs that provide not just trades, but **true tick-level, order-by-order, event-by-event data** (not aggregated candles).

* They want:
  + Full trade-by-trade (tick) data
  + Order book events (inserts, cancels, modifies)
  + *Both* real-time streams and historical archives

So what sets good providers apart?

* **Data quality** (true tick, not just trade prints or candle aggregates)
* **Normalizing across venues** (so you don‚Äôt have to remap symbols)
* **Transparent and robust documentation**
* **Bulk access for historical research** (not just ‚Äúlive‚Äù feeds)
* **Developer experience** (good docs, stable APIs, support)
* **Clear, usage-based or flat pricing**

Data transparency matters. CoinAPI provides not just normalized, timestamped feeds, but also public schemas, versioned documentation, and downloadable samples, so you can actually check and trust what you‚Äôre getting before building your pipeline. CoinAPI offers millisecond timestamps, normalized schema, historical flat files, and responsive support, no more trading blind.

**Market microstructure: Why every micro-event matters**
--------------------------------------------------------

Serious quant/dev users want to see *every* event (inserts, cancels, modifications, trades) to reconstruct the order book or simulate fills accurately. The more granular the data, the less room for ‚Äúvendor bias‚Äù or missed alpha.

If you care about real market microstructure‚Äîslippage, queue priority, or high-frequency signals, tiny gaps in data will sink your backtest. That‚Äôs why CoinAPI exposes every event, every microsecond, normalized and documented, so you‚Äôre modeling the real market, not a vendor‚Äôs incomplete version.‚Äù

Even for a single liquid instrument, the tick stream can be overwhelming (hundreds of MB or more per day).

Most users seriously underestimate the engineering effort required to just receive, parse, and store the stream, let alone *analyze* it in real time.

*‚ÄúNot all APIs are equal‚Äù*: Some APIs batch, some drop micro-events, and some are prone to delays or throttling.

The real challenge with tick data starts after you subscribe. Streams from active markets are a firehose, hundreds of megabytes per day, with every insert, cancel, and trade event flowing in real time. CoinAPI helps you manage this scale, whether you need streaming APIs for live bots or flat files for long-term storage, and delivers the normalization that makes real-time analysis feasible.

**Compression and storage - absolute musts**
--------------------------------------------

Always compress! Raw tick data is unwieldy. Many use gzip, zstd, or similar, sometimes compressing ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù as they receive data. CoinAPI‚Äôs flat files are easily gzip-compressible and structured for storage in S3, cloud buckets, or local cold storage, perfect for years-long research projects.

**Clear demand for BOTH real time and historical raw tick data**
----------------------------------------------------------------

Quant traders frequently struggle to find sources for both live and historical tick-by-tick crypto data, especially with full order book events, not just trade prints. CoinAPI bridges this gap, offering unified, normalized feeds for both real-time and historical data, covering every insert, cancel, and trade across 370+ venues.‚Äù

**What does ‚ÄúRaw tick by tick data‚Äù mean?**
-------------------------------------------

For real backtests, quants don‚Äôt want aggregates or summaries; they need the raw event stream, with every insert, cancel, and trade, timestamped for full market reconstruction. CoinAPI delivers this: you can replay or backtest the exact market microstructure as it unfolded, not just an after-the-fact chart.

**Order book snapshots vs. Live market data: Clearing up the confusion**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Several users wonder about the difference between *live/streaming market data* (real-time feeds) and *snapshots* (a static picture of the order book at a moment in time).
* Some mistakenly assume snapshots update continuously or are as granular as live tick feeds.
* More advanced replies clarify:
  + A **snapshot** is a *full view* of the order book (or top N levels) at a particular instant‚Äîthink of it as a photo, not a movie.
  + Snapshots are **typically updated every few seconds** (or on demand), and do not capture every single book event in between.

As the r/interactivebrokers community discusses, an order book snapshot is like a photograph‚Äîit captures the full state of the order book at one moment, but not the continuous flow of events. If you need to monitor real-time liquidity or initialize a trading engine, snapshots are essential for a quick start. For modeling microstructure or simulating fills, you‚Äôll want to combine snapshots with tick-by-tick book updates.‚Äù

**How to Access orderbook snapshots and tick by tick data with CoinAPI**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Full-depth, historical tick-by-tick order book data is currently available via CoinAPI Flat Files only. The REST API supports snapshots of the top 20 levels for recent or historical order book data, but not the full event stream or all levels. For real-time tick-by-tick order book updates, use the WebSocket streaming API.

**Order Book Snapshots (up to 20 levels, via REST Market Data API):**

```
1bash
2
3GET /v1/orderbooks/{symbol_id}/latest        // Latest snapshot (top 20 levels)
4GET /v1/orderbooks/{symbol_id}/history       // Historical snapshots (top 20 levels, paginated)
```

*Note: The REST API only returns up to 20 levels per snapshot, not full depth.*

**Full Historical Tick-by-Tick Order Book Data:**

* **Available via Flat Files only**. Download these from CoinAPI‚Äôs Flat File Data Service for complete, research-grade historical coverage of the order book (all levels, all updates).

**Real-Time Full Order Book Data:**

* **Available via WebSocket streaming API**. Subscribe for the full tick-by-tick stream in real time (all events, all levels).

Understanding Real-Time WebSocket Updates: Why You Get Multiple Messages
------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the most common questions we receive is: *"Why am I getting multiple WebSocket responses for the same ticker instead of one aggregated response?"*

This is **by design** and here's why it actually benefits your trading systems:

### How CoinAPI WebSocket Updates Work

When you subscribe to real-time data via WebSocket, you'll receive updates in two scenarios:

1. **Every 5 seconds** during active trading periods (even if the period hasn't closed)
2. **When a period closes** (e.g., when a new minute begins for 1-minute data)

### Why Multiple Updates Instead of Single Aggregated Responses?

**Real-time accuracy over convenience:** Markets move fast. Waiting until the end of a time period to send data means you're always working with outdated information.

**Example:**

```
1// Traditional approach (what some expect):
212:00:59 - Send OHLCV for entire minute
3
4// CoinAPI approach (what we actually do):
512:00:05 - Send current OHLCV state  
612:00:10 - Send updated OHLCV state
712:00:15 - Send updated OHLCV state
8... (every 5 seconds)
912:01:00 - Send final OHLCV for completed minute
```

#### **Benefits of This Approach**

**For Trading Applications:**

* React to market changes within seconds, not minutes
* Update charts and indicators in real-time
* Trigger alerts based on current, not historical, price movements

**For Risk Management:**

* Monitor position exposure with up-to-the-second data
* Set dynamic stop-losses based on real market conditions
* Get early warning of significant price movements

### How to Handle Multiple Updates in Your Code

**Option 1: Use the Latest Update (Most Common)**

```
1let currentOHLCV = {};
2
3websocket.onmessage = function(event) {
4    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
5    if (data.type === 'ohlcv') {
6        // Simply replace with latest data
7        currentOHLCV[data.symbol_id] = data;
8        updateCharts(currentOHLCV);
9    }
10};
```

**Option 2: Store Complete History**

```
1let ohlcvHistory = {};
2
3websocket.onmessage = function(event) {
4    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
5    if (data.type === 'ohlcv') {
6        if (!ohlcvHistory[data.symbol_id]) {
7            ohlcvHistory[data.symbol_id] = [];
8        }
9        ohlcvHistory[data.symbol_id].push(data);
10    }
11};
```

**Option 3: Only Use Period-End Data**

```
1websocket.onmessage = function(event) {
2    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
3    if (data.type === 'ohlcv') {
4        // Check if this is a completed period
5        const now = new Date();
6        const periodEnd = new Date(data.time_period_end);
7        
8        if (periodEnd <= now) {
9            // This is final data for the period
10            processFinalOHLCV(data);
11        }
12    }
13};
```

#### **Alternative: Use REST API for Single Responses**

If you prefer single, aggregated responses per time period, use our REST API instead:

```
1# Get completed OHLCV data without real-time updates
2GET /v1/ohlcv/BINANCE_SPOT_BTC_USDT/latest?period_id=1MIN
```

**Learn more about different data access methods** in our [OHLCV Data Explained guide](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/ohlcv-data-explained-a-practical-guide-for-traders-and-quants).

#### **Real Customer Feedback**

As one algorithmic trader noted, *"Initially, I was frustrated by multiple updates, but then I realized this gives me a massive advantage. I can adjust my strategies based on intraday momentum instead of waiting for period completion."*

The key insight: **This isn't a limitation, it's a competitive advantage.** You're getting market information faster than traders using end-of-period data only.

**TL;DR The real challenge is what you do with the data**
---------------------------------------------------------

Receiving tick data is just the start, the real edge is how you manage, store, and analyze it. The r/algotrading community is clear: invest in infrastructure and normalization, or risk drowning in your data. CoinAPI exists to take you from the firehose to real, actionable research.

**What Should You Remember?**

* Snapshots = efficient, point-in-time depth, great for trends and dashboards
* Tick-by-tick = every change, critical for serious backtesting and execution
* Free APIs rarely deliver what you need for research or production
* Normalization and completeness are the real edge, don‚Äôt skip them!

**With CoinAPI, accessing tick-by-tick and snapshot order book data from 380+ exchanges is effortless.** Whether you‚Äôre building trading algos, visualizing liquidity, or running analytics, the unified endpoints, rich docs, and scalable infrastructure give you everything you need.
