Cryptocurrency exchange rates
=============================

![featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2F456bb7adb2224e16a74a82a0c3ef45cc8307493e-1000x500.png%3Frect%3D0%2C33%2C1000%2C435%26w%3D920%26h%3D400&w=1920&q=75)

***In the traditional world of [fiat money](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/fiat-money-currency/), exchange rates are simply ‚Äúthe rates at which the money of one country can be changed for the money of another country‚Äù. However, in the world of cryptocurrencies, which no country officially controls or ties to itself, the definition needs some adjustment. Let‚Äôs break it down!***

What are crypto exchange rates?
-------------------------------

In the crypto context, an **exchange rate** can be explained as both:

**The value at which:**

* **One cryptocurrency can be exchanged for another ‚Äì e.g. BTC to ETH**
* **A cryptocurrency can be exchanged for a fiat currency ‚Äì e.g. SOL to USD**

In general, these rates are dynamic. They can change based on market supply and demand, similar to traditional currencies. Obviously, external factors like market sentiment, economic news, regulatory changes, technological developments, trends, and many others (e.g. Dogecoin‚Äôs rise after endorsement from Elon Musk) can cause these changes as well.

> *üí° An exchange rate is always a pair of assets e.g. BTC/SOL or ETH/EUR.*

What is the difference between the exchange rate and price in cryptocurrencies?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People often use these terms interchangeably, which can confuse them.

### **Exchange rate**

The value of one (crypto)currency compared to another. Used in trading and converting assets. *For example, if the BTC/ETH exchange rate is 20, one Bitcoin can be exchanged for 20 ETH.*

### **Price**

The value of a single unit of a cryptocurrency in terms of fiat currency or another cryptocurrency. *For example, if Bitcoin is priced at $30,000, one Bitcoin is worth $30,000.*

Types of Crypto Exchange Rates
------------------------------

Different types of exchange rates exist based on asset pairs, timing, data sources, and calculation methods. Hence, when choosing an exchange rate platform, it‚Äôs essential to understand these differences.

### **Free-floating vs Fixed**

* **Free-floating exchange rate:** the value of a crypto dictated by market supply and demand without direct intervention of a central authority. Consequently, most cryptocurrencies operate like that.
  + *Example: [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/) to US dollar (BTC/USD); [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) to Euro (ETH/EUR)*
* **Fixed exchange rate:** A fixed exchange rate, also known as a pegged exchange rate, is one where the value of a cryptocurrency is tied to another currency, commodity, or cryptocurrency. An example is Tether (USDT), which is pegged to the US Dollar, aiming to maintain a 1:1 value ratio.
  + *Example: [Tether](https://tether.to/en/) to US dollar (USDT/USD); [USD Coin](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc) to US dollar (USDC/USD)*

**Spot vs Forward value**

* **Spot rate (cash value):** The [spot rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spotprice.asp) is the current market price at which a cryptocurrency can be bought or sold for immediate delivery. For instance, if you check the current price of Ethereum (ETH) on an exchange like Binance, that price is its spot rate.
  + *Example: Spot price of Bitcoin on an exchange*
* **Forward value rate:** The [forward rate](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042315/what-difference-between-forward-rate-and-spot-rate.asp) is an agreed-upon and predicted price for a cryptocurrency transaction that will occur at a future date. So, professionals often use forward contracts to hedge against price volatility. For example, a trader might agree to buy Bitcoin at a set price in three months to avoid potential price spikes.
  + *Example: Bitcoin forward futures contract*

### **Single vs Aggregated**

* **Single exchange rate:** This is the rate provided by a single exchange platform. The price might vary significantly between different platforms due to differences in supply and demand. For example, the price of Bitcoin on Coinbase might differ from its price on Kraken at any given time.
  + *Example: [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) price on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/pl/)*
* **Aggregated exchange rate:** An aggregated exchange rate combines prices from multiple exchanges to provide an average rate. This approach aims to give a more balanced and accurate view of the market. Services like CoinGecko or CoinAPI often use aggregated exchange rates to present a more comprehensive market price.
  + *Example: Bitcoin price via Market Data API; Ethereum aggregated price on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)*

### **VWAP vs VWAP-24H vs Order book**

* **Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP):** It is a trading benchmark that gives the average price a cryptocurrency has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price. It provides traders with insight into the market trend and the average price they might expect to pay
  + *Example: Bitcoin VWAP on [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/)*
* **Volume-Weighted Average Price 24H (VWAP-24H):** Similar to VWAP, but calculated over a 24-hour period. This gives a broader view of the average trading price over a full day, which is useful for traders looking to understand longer-term trends.
  + *Example: [Solana](https://solana.com/pl) VWAP-24H via Market Data API*
* **Order book analysis:** This involves examining the list of buy and sell orders on an exchange‚Äôs order book to understand market sentiment and liquidity. The order book can show where the majority of buy or sell orders are clustered, indicating potential support or resistance levels.
  + *Example: [Litecoin](https://litecoin.org/) order book on [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/)*

How are exchange rates calculated?
----------------------------------

There are many ways an exchange or data source can estimate or calculate an exchange rate. Some people focus on the [Simple Moving Average (SMA)](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/technical-analysis/technical-indicator-guide/sma), or just the average or median value from a specific period.

One of the most common and reliable methods of exchange rate calculation is to use the `VWAP` ([Volume Weighted Average Price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vwap.asp)) over the last 24 hours, known as `VWAP-24H`.

Afterward, to make the method even more accurate the value should be calculated **based on the data from multiple exchanges** (aggregated data). Aggregated data gives us the overlook of the entire market, and eliminates potential errors that could occur on a single exchange.

### Example of **Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) Calculation** calculation

Let‚Äôs imagine that this simple order book below represents real data that we‚Äôll calculate right now.

#### **Buy Orders (Bids)**

* Price: $69,800 USD, Amount: 0.5 BTC
* Price: $69,850 USD, Amount: 0.7 BTC
* Price: $69,900 USD, Amount: 1.0 BTC

#### **Sell Orders (Asks)**

* Price: $70,000 USD, Amount: 0.3 BTC
* Price: $70,050 USD, Amount: 0.6 BTC
* Price: $70,100 USD, Amount: 0.8 BTC

We have three ‚ÄúBuy Orders‚Äù and the same amount of ‚ÄúSell Orders‚Äù. Again it‚Äôs a simple example that shows the thought behind the equation. Usually, we have hundreds or thousands of records to calculate from.

![VWAP formula](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2Fb6792d8b8d9875610fca0bb8630b2eee13326696-300x78.webp&w=1920&q=75)

*Source: Tradewell.app*

#### Step-by-step VWAP calculation

1. **The sum of (Price √ó Volume) for all trades:** First, we have to take all of the amounts sold (Volume) and multiply it by the price in USD.(69,800√ó0.5)+(69,850√ó0.7)+(69,900√ó1.0)+(70,000√ó0.3)+(70,050√ó0.6)+(70,100√ó0.8) = 34,900+48,895+69,900+21,000+42,030+56,080=272,805
2. **The sum of Volumes:** Then we just sum up the volumes.0.5+0.7+1.0+0.3+0.6+0.8=3.9
3. **VWAP Calculation**The only thing left is to take the sum of (Volume x Price) and divide it by Volume**VWAP=272,805/3.9=69,950**

So, the VWAP for BTC/USD is approximately **$69,950**

CoinAPI‚Äôs Market Data API
-------------------------

We base our exchange rate calculation on the `VWAP-24H` method, multiple data sources, and protocols (e.g. REST API and Websocket) to calculate the exchange rate, we carefully manage the data sources to have even higher-quality data. Basically, here‚Äôs how the algorithm works:

1. **Data Sources**: Only legitimate data from spot markets are used.
2. **Filtering**: Alghoritms discard data with large spreads or outdated quotes (over 5 minutes old)
3. **Price Calculation**: Midpoint prices from quotes are weighted by trade volumes.
4. **Regular Updates**: The VWAP is updated every second, and the 24-hour volume for each symbol is refreshed every 4 hours.
5. **Data Quality**: Market Data API includes only the highest-ranked exchanges and excludes outliers (3 sigma range) if enough data points exist.
6. **Final Rate**: A tree structure and our proprietary method finalize the exchange rates.

Additionally, our crypto exchange rates are accurately delivered data from many data sources. The goal behind creating such a feature was to eliminate the need to check the price on separate exchanges and have an aggregated and more resilient overlook of a crypto market.
