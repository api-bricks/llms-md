Token liquidity plummets leaving bag holders high and dry
=========================================================

***As cryptocurrency prices continue their downward spiral, a more alarming trend is emerging in the shadows: a severe token liquidity crisis. Despite the allure of bargain prices, trading volumes have nosedived across major exchanges, leaving many tokens gasping for liquidity.***

***This unexpected development is reshaping the cryptocurrency landscape, challenging both veteran and novice traders alike. Our in-depth analysis reveals the extent of this liquidity crunch and its far-reaching implications for the future of digital asset trading.***

Volumes plummet despite price drops
-----------------------------------

Cryptocurrency prices have plunged 80-95% since the start of the year. Yet, traders arenâ€™t rushing to buy at these lower prices. Token liquidity has significantly decreased across major exchanges. 60% of listed cryptocurrencies are trading below January levels. Order books are now heavily skewed towards the sell side. November has seen an acceleration in declining volumes.

Token Liquidity Squeeze: Over 20% of Cryptocurrencies Face Critical Volume Loss
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Over 20% of cryptocurrencies that remain listed on major exchanges (see note on examined exchanges) now have less than 90% of the trading volumes they witnessed at peak hype in January. More than half of those are effectively dead in the water with no traders looking to buy.

A Handful of Outliers
---------------------

On the other end of the spectrum, 102 of 410 tokens saw volumes increase by more than 100% in January compared to October. November, however, shows that this number has dropped to 91 within less than a month. Only a handful of tokens have found some increase in volume.

Token Liquidity Variations Across Exchanges
-------------------------------------------

Liquidity from one exchange to the other differs, however â€“ quite dramatically in some cases. For Poloniex, quite literally all listed tokens have less trading volume than at the start of the year. In the case of Bittrex â€“ three tokens (see interactive chart below). The outliers, by reported volume at least, are OKEx and Huobi, with Binance having a fairly equal share of trading volumes across the percentage bands. Just under half of Binanceâ€™s listings have decreased volumes compared to the start of the year.

New Token Liquidity Challenges: Fresh Listings Struggle
-------------------------------------------------------

Over 75% of the tokens that have been added to exchange this year have seen their volumes in complete decline in October versus November (see chart).
