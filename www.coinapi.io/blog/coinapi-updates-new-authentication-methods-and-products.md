CoinAPI Updates: S3 API introduction and new authentication methods
===================================================================

![featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2F759655d533c184dbca543412e66085a4203c091b-1000x500.png%3Frect%3D0%2C33%2C1000%2C435%26w%3D920%26h%3D400&w=1920&q=75)

With our recent CoinAPI updates, we‚Äôve integrated exciting new security features, introduced S3 API, and unveiled the eagerly awaited Node-as-a-Service. These improvements reflect our commitment to providing the most comprehensive tools tailored to your needs. Let‚Äôs delve into the specifics of these CoinAPI updates and explore what we‚Äôve rolled out in the past few weeks.

**Exciting Updates in CoinAPI Authentication Methods**
------------------------------------------------------

We‚Äôre thrilled to announce some significant enhancements to CoinAPI‚Äôs authentication methods. We understand that the security and accessibility of our services are critical to our users, so we have been working tirelessly to introduce these new features that will both strengthen security and streamline the user experience.

### **Enhanced API Key Authentication**

At the heart of our authentication process remains the API key. However, we‚Äôve now expanded its capabilities by enabling it to be used in conjunction with a JWT (JSON Web Tokens) token. This innovative combination improves security, particularly when the API key needs to be shared publicly, such as when accessing CoinAPI endpoints from frontend JavaScript code.

### **Comprehensive Support Across Products**

We are proud to announce that CoinAPI now supports a wide range of authentication methods for various products, including API keys, query parameters, URL paths, authorization headers, basic authentication, JWT tokens, TLS Client Certificates, SenderCompID, and AWS Signature Version 4. This wide array of options allows users to choose the authentication method that best suits their needs, providing flexibility and control.

### **JWT Authentication: Greater Security and Efficiency**

Our support for JWT authentication has been enhanced, offering a secure and efficient way to authorize requests. We now support a multitude of algorithms for JWT token verification, providing increased security. Enabling JWT authentication has been made easier, and we‚Äôve added comprehensive guidance to help you navigate this process.

### **Emphasis on JWT Token Expiration**

To ensure the validity of JWT tokens and prevent the use of expired tokens, we‚Äôve emphasized the inclusion of ‚ÄúNBF‚Äù (Not Before) and ‚ÄúEXP‚Äù (Expiration Time) claims in the tokens. Tokens that don‚Äôt meet these requirements will not be accepted, further fortifying our commitment to secure access to our resources.

### **More Authentication Options: TLS Client Cert, SenderCompID, AWS Signature Version 4**

We have introduced additional authentication methods to provide even more flexibility to our users. This includes the TLS Client Certificate option for secure session establishment, the SenderCompID for FIX protocol users, and the AWS Signature Version 4, which uses an authorization request header for authorization information.

These updates reflect our commitment to providing a secure and user-friendly experience for all CoinAPI users. We believe these new features will provide greater control over authentication processes while strengthening the overall security of access to our services.

Please visit our [documentation page](Link to the documentation page) for more detailed instructions on how to use these new authentication methods. As always, we‚Äôre here to support you in this transition and answer any questions you may have.

**A spotlight on education: Introducing Case Studies and Use Cases**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

At CoinAPI, we understand that the best way to appreciate the full potential of our product is by seeing it in action. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre excited to announce our renewed focus on educational content, featuring real-world customer stories and use cases. **Our aim is to show you not just what CoinAPI can do, but also how it‚Äôs helping to solve real-world problems** in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

**Our forthcoming case studies will provide an in-depth look at how CoinAPI is being used across various scenarios and sectors.** From startups to established companies, these case studies will cover a broad spectrum of users and use cases, providing insights into how our platform can be leveraged to meet diverse needs.

Through this initiative, we hope to not only provide valuable information but also inspire new ways of thinking about how our platform can be utilized. We firmly believe that knowledge is power, and we‚Äôre eager to share this power with you. Keep an eye out for the release of our new website and these informative resources!

**Unveiling the S3 API: A Solution for streamlined data management**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We are thrilled to announce the release of CoinAPI S3 API. The CoinAPI S3 API is designed to streamline and simplify data management for our users. **It addresses some of the common challenges associated with handling large volumes of cryptocurrency market data.** As cryptocurrency markets grow and diversify, businesses and individuals are inundated with data from multiple sources, making it increasingly complex to manage, analyze, and extract actionable insights.

Our S3 API bridges this gap by offering a **reliable and efficient way to access, store, and retrieve cryptocurrency market data.** With its robust compatibility and integration with [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/) S3 services, the CoinAPI S3 API allows users to leverage the scalability, security, and performance of the Amazon S3 platform, ensuring seamless data management and retrieval processes.

**The S3 API is designed to handle vast amounts of data, providing you with the capacity to store and access extensive historical and real-time market data.** Whether you are a trader seeking to backtest strategies using historical data or a research institution requiring extensive datasets for analysis, the CoinAPI S3 API is tailored to accommodate these needs.

**Coming Soon: CoinAPI‚Äôs Node-as-a-Service Beta Release**
---------------------------------------------------------

We are thrilled to announce the upcoming beta release of our latest product: **Node-as-a-Service.**

Node-as-a-Service is a solution that aims to democratize access to blockchain data by eliminating the complexity of setting up and maintaining your own blockchain nodes. It‚Äôs essentially a **cloud-based service that offers on-demand, scalable access to fully synchronized blockchain nodes across multiple networks.**

Maintaining blockchain nodes on your own can be quite challenging. It requires significant resources, including hardware, bandwidth, and technical expertise to set up, manage, and ensure the node‚Äôs security. Moreover, syncing a node can take weeks or even months, making it an arduous process that might not fit the fast-paced needs of businesses and developers in the crypto industry.

With CoinAPI‚Äôs Node-as-a-Service, these hurdles are removed. Our solution enables anyone, regardless of their technical proficiency, to **leverage the full power of blockchain nodes without worrying about setup, maintenance, or infrastructure costs.** It‚Äôs as simple as making an API call to access the data you need when you need it.

The upcoming beta release will provide users with an opportunity to experience our Node-as-a-Service solution and contribute to its final development through their valuable feedback. By participating in the beta release, you can help us shape this service to better fit your needs and the broader community.

**Customer portal changes**
---------------------------

Lastly, we‚Äôve made significant changes to our customer portal for a more seamless and intuitive user experience. While maintaining the core functionalities, we‚Äôve improved navigation, added new features, and enhanced the overall interface to make managing your account and accessing our services even easier.

Stay tuned as we continue to roll out more enhancements and features in the coming weeks. As always, we remain committed to delivering cutting-edge solutions that empower you in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency market. Visit our [blog](https://blog.coinapi.io/) to stay tuned for updates.
