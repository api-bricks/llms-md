Coinbase Introduces PayPal Withdrawal Fee for Crypto Users
==========================================================

***Coinbase, one of America’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has recently made crypto-to-cash conversions easier and faster by integrating PayPal Instant Cash Withdrawals. While this new feature eliminates PayPal withdrawal fees, users should still be aware of other Coinbase fees that may apply to different types of transactions, including withdrawal fees for other methods. This new feature allows users to transfer their cryptocurrency funds to their PayPal accounts instantly and without fees, thus marking a significant improvement in the accessibility and liquidity of digital assets.***

Using PayPal as a Payment Method with Coinbase
----------------------------------------------

Using PayPal as a payment method with Coinbase is a convenient and secure way to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrencies. To link your PayPal account to Coinbase, you need to complete identity document verification and confirm your country of residence. Once linked, you can use PayPal to buy cryptocurrencies, add cash to your Coinbase account, or withdraw funds to your PayPal account. This integration offers a seamless experience, allowing you to manage your crypto assets with ease and confidence.

How to link your Coinbase and PayPal account
--------------------------------------------

Firstly, customers can now connect their PayPal and Coinbase accounts. However, new users must complete all ID verification steps. Meanwhile, existing customers should link their PayPal accounts to instant, free withdrawals. After verification, therefore, look for the PayPal withdrawal option. Be aware that a transaction fee may apply depending on the amount and method of withdrawal. Nevertheless, the feature may not be available in your region yet if you don’t see it. For users who prefer not to use PayPal, linking a bank account to Coinbase can also facilitate withdrawals, though different fees may apply.

Withdrawing Funds from Coinbase to PayPal
-----------------------------------------

Withdrawing funds from Coinbase to PayPal is a straightforward process. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Coinbase account and go to the “Withdraw” section.
2. Select PayPal as your withdrawal method.
3. Enter the amount you want to withdraw and confirm the transaction.
4. The funds will be transferred to your PayPal account, where you can access them immediately.

This process ensures that your funds are quickly and securely moved from your Coinbase account to your PayPal account, providing you with instant access to your [money](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/at-the-money-atm).

Limitations of Coinbase's PayPal integration and withdrawal fees
----------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, PayPal only supports withdrawals and sales. You can’t buy digital currency with your PayPal account on Coinbase. Depending on your location, you can withdraw cash to PayPal or sell crypto directly to your account.

### How Long Does Coinbase Withdrawal Take?

The time it takes to withdraw funds from Coinbase can vary. If you prefer, you can also withdraw funds to a linked bank account, though this may take longer and involve different fees. Typically, withdrawals to PayPal are faster, but the exact time can depend on various factors including your location and the amount being withdrawn.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues with PayPal Withdrawals

* **Check for network fees**: Network fees may apply to your withdrawal, which can affect the amount of funds received. Ensure you understand these fees before initiating a withdrawal.
* **Verify your PayPal account**: Make sure your PayPal account is verified and linked correctly to avoid any issues.
* **Check your email**: Look for any emails from Coinbase or PayPal that might require action on your part.
* **Contact support**: If you’ve tried the above steps and still face issues, reach out to Coinbase support for further assistance.

How Long Does Coinbase Withdrawal Take?
---------------------------------------

The time it takes for a Coinbase withdrawal to be processed depends on the payment method used. For PayPal withdrawals, the funds are typically available in your PayPal account immediately. However, it may take a few minutes for the transaction to be processed. This rapid transfer time makes PayPal an efficient option for accessing your funds quickly.

Troubleshooting Common Issues with PayPal Withdrawals
-----------------------------------------------------

If you encounter issues with PayPal withdrawals, here are some common solutions:

* **Check your PayPal account balance:** Ensure that you have sufficient funds in your PayPal account to cover the withdrawal amount.
* **Verify your PayPal account:** Make sure your PayPal account is verified and linked to your Coinbase account.
* **Check for network fees:** Network fees may apply to your withdrawal, which can affect the amount of funds received.
* **Contact PayPal support:** If you encounter issues with your PayPal account or transaction, contact PayPal support for assistance.

By following these steps, you can resolve most common issues and ensure a smooth withdrawal process from Coinbase to PayPal.

**Coinbase and PayPal: available countries and future expansion**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The service supports PayPal accounts in the U.S., Jersey, Norway, Romania, Switzerland, and San Marino. Coinbase plans to expand to more countries throughout 2019. You’ll receive an email with linking instructions when available in your area. Additionally, users should be aware that their own fees from banks or payment platforms may apply, depending on their location and the specific services used.

**The History of the collaboration**
------------------------------------

Coinbase and PayPal first integrated in 2016 but ended the partnership due to technical issues. This limited users to ACH transfers and bank wire transfers. These traditional methods can take 2-3 business days and involve various fees.

PayPal's crypto assets ambitions
--------------------------------

PayPal filed a U.S. patent in March to speed up cryptocurrency payments. Their “Expedited Virtual Currency Transaction System” aims to reduce transaction times between consumers and traders.

In the future, PayPal may also explore the integration of debit card payments to further expedite cryptocurrency transactions.

**Coinbase's expanding services beyond PayPal integration**
-----------------------------------------------------------

This PayPal integration improves Coinbase’s service range. As Coinbase expands its services, users should also be mindful of the exchange rate fluctuations that can impact the value of their transactions. In September, Coinbase announced plans to list more digital assets quickly. Last month, they began considering up to 31 new coins, including Ripple, EOS, and Cardano. Additionally, users may need to pay fees for certain transactions, which can vary based on the payment method and the specific cryptocurrency involved.
