What CoinAPI Offers for Large-Scale Clients
===========================================

![featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2F08be37bf0637dde2540390f0e752b620e9777d8a-1000x500.png%3Frect%3D0%2C33%2C1000%2C435%26w%3D920%26h%3D400&w=1920&q=75)

Since cryptocurrencies have evolved into a serious investment vehicle for institutional players, financial companies, hedge funds, and enterprise organizations demand sophisticated services that match traditional financial markets' standards. They operate at a scale where **data integrity, system reliability, and contractual guarantees are not just features but fundamental requirements for their operations.**

At CoinAPI, we understand these needs and have designed our Enterprise plan to deliver comprehensive cryptocurrency data solutions that meet the exacting standards of large-scale businesses. It caters to entities that need extensive customization, high data volumes, and dedicated support to seamlessly integrate CoinAPI's services into their existing systems. In this article, we want to present to you **how our top-tier plan addresses even the most complex challenges related to crypto market data**.

Unlimited Data Access for High-Volume Operations
------------------------------------------------

The cryptocurrency market never sleeps, generating massive amounts of data through 24/7 trading and constant price movements. Our Enterprise plan supports this intensity by offering **unlimited or custom-tailored access through multiple protocols:**

* REST
* JSON-RPC
* WebSocket V1/DS
* [FIX API](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/fix-api-vs-rest-api)

This flexibility ensures our clients can access both historical and real-time data from hundreds of cryptocurrency exchanges without hitting usage limits, even during peak trading periods.

Performance When It Matters Most
--------------------------------

Financial enterprises engaging in cryptocurrency trading operate in an environment where split-second decisions can significantly impact their bottom line. The availability of reliable and timely data becomes critical as these organizations manage substantial positions, execute complex trading strategies (like [high-frequency trading](https://www.coinapi.io/blog/high-frequency-treading-strategies-in-crypto)), and maintain risk management protocols.

For this reason, CoinAPI offers a **dedicated infrastructure designed to deliver data with minimal latency**. This ensures data reliability and speed essential for time-sensitive applications like trading platforms. We maintain dedicated servers across North America, Europe, and Japan through AWS, and we offer:

* Custom server setups near your location
* Collocation options
* Infrastructure tailored to your specific performance requirements.

Dedicated Features
------------------

As an organization, we are ready to fulfill special client requirements and develop dedicated features. The way it works is that together we prepare a **shared product development roadmap for the customer and commit to it.** Then, we prioritize the features outlined in the roadmap. Moreover, we can offer **additional development hours** each month for modifications and improvements if needed. CoinAPI also allows for flexible data delivery methods tailored to specific location, latency, and format preferences, ensuring data arrives most efficiently for the business. Upon a clientâ€™s request, we can also integrate additional exchanges and assets.

Enhanced Security
-----------------

Ensuring the security of data and integrations is paramount for enterprise clients using CoinAPI's services. Thatâ€™s why we provide advanced security measures for secure and authenticated communication between clients and servers, exclusively available to Enterprise Plan customers. The examples of our key features are:

1. **API Key Authentication**: A fundamental method for authenticating and controlling access to CoinAPI services.
2. **JWT Token Authentication**: An extended security measure combining API keys with JWT tokens for enhanced protection.
3. **TLS Encryption:** All communications are encrypted using TLS 1.2 (AES-256) or higher, ensuring data confidentiality during transmission and preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.
4. **TLS Client Certificates**: Used for authenticating FIX sessions and Managed Cloud REST API access.
5. **Mutual TLS Support (mTLS)** - provides authenticated and encrypted communication between clients and servers. Unlike standard TLS, mTLS requires both parties to present certificates, ensuring that both the client and server are verified and trusted.
6. **IP Whitelisting** - allows enterprises to restrict access to CoinAPI services by specifying which IP addresses can connect. This ensures that only authorized systems within the organization can access the API, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access and potential breaches.
7. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** - monitors and filters HTTP requests based on predefined security rules. By implementing a WAF, enterprises can protect their applications from common web exploits and attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), enhancing overall security posture.
8. **Security Groups** - offer granular control over network access by defining specific IP ranges that are permitted to communicate with CoinAPI services. This is particularly useful for cloud-hosted environments, where security groups can be configured to allow access only from trusted networks or segments.
9. **Principle of Least Privilege** - adhering to the â€˜Principle of Least Privilegeâ€™, CoinAPI ensures that authentication methods provided to clients do not require administrative privileges. This minimizes the potential attack surface by granting only the necessary permissions required for specific operations.
10. **Enhanced Authentication Methods** - beyond mTLS, the Enterprise Plan may include additional robust authentication mechanisms tailored to meet the stringent security requirements of large organizations, ensuring secure access and data integrity.

To learn more about [security and compliance](https://docs.coinapi.io/general/security), we encourage you to take a peek at our documentation.

Compliance and Legal Assurance
------------------------------

To meet specific legal and compliance standards, CoinAPI allows for **custom legal terms and custom Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** with high uptime guarantees measured by a third party for added transparency.

Integration with Existing Systems
---------------------------------

We offer enterprise customers dedicated assistance in **integrating our services into existing systems, reducing development time, and optimizing performance**. Our support and development teams are ready to promptly address issues and provide strategic guidance, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted service.

Premium Support
---------------

Customer support is crucial in digital services. For premium customers, we are available around the clock for **immediate assistance**, which is suited to businesses operating at any hour. To further reduce waiting time, we set up a dedicated channel on Slack for quick communication for support requests and a dedicated Customer Experience Specialist.

The Bottom Line
---------------

Every organization has unique requirements, and we pride ourselves on our flexibility to meet them. Our team is ready to discuss your specific needs and create a customized solution that perfectly aligns with your operations.
