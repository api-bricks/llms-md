Protocols

WebSocket V1 API

WebSocket DS API

The minimal latency version of the WebSocket API requires a separate connection per data source, which is more directly terminated at the collocated site for that data source.

FIX API

FIX Protocol is billed separately. Single Session means that for every day, 24 Connection-Hours are included in the Quota. CH unit is Connection-Hour, which means 1 connection/session established for 1 hour.

### Transparent, scalable, usage-based pricing

REST CreditsTier 1 DataTier 2 DataFIX API

#### REST Credits

REST Credits are requests made to our servers to retrieve data via the REST protocol. Each time you fetch data, the number of requests varies based on the endpoint used and the amount of data requested.

* For example, if the limit query parameter is used, each 100 data points returned is counted as one request.
* If the limit query parameter is not used or not available, each API call you make is counted as one request.

Pricing is tiered based on your daily usage:

* Calculated per 1,000 calls
* Tiers reset daily
* Rates decrease as usage increases
* Usage covered by the committed-usage plan quota is counted

Higher volume users automatically benefit from lower rates. See the table below for specific pricing tiers.  
  
Example 1 - Pay As You Go

* Let's say you will use 2,500 REST API Credits in one day
* First 1,000 REST API Credits will be priced at $5.26 / 1k credits = $5.26
* Final 1,500 REST API Credits will be priced at $2.63 / 1k credits = $3.95
* Total cost for this day will be $9.21

Example 2 - Professional with Pay As You Go

* Let's say you will use 150,000 REST API Credits in one day while having active Professional subscription
* Professional plan have commited-usage quota of 100,00 REST API Credits / day.
* First 100,000 REST API Credits will not be charged as they are within the plan quota.
* Final 50,000 REST API Credits will be priced at $0.20 / 1k calls = $10.00
* Total cost for this day will be $10.00 on top of the Professional subscription
