#### Banking & Financial Infrastructure

### Launch Regulated Crypto Services with Bank-Grade Data Infrastructure

[Start Now](https://www.coinapi.io/products/market-data-api/pricing)

![background](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fo65xz72l%2Fproduction%2F0ba9693a5ceac7f2d94794d195bdcf5966c89324-1024x661.png&w=3840&q=75)

##### Launching crypto services without proper infrastructure is like opening a vault without security systems.

Legacy systems, compliance risk, and fragmented exchange data make it nearly impossible for banks to compete with agile crypto platforms. At the same time, clients demand digital asset access, and regulators expect full control. You need a partner thatâ€™s enterprise-ready from day one, secure, fast, and compliant.

### What are the pain points when building modern banking infrastructure?

![background](/img/usecase/section-points.svg)

No unified data platform, each exchange requires its own costly integration

![background](/img/usecase/section-points.svg)

Months of engineering to normalize order books, prices, and transaction histories

![background](/img/usecase/section-points.svg)

Inability to offer best execution across fragmented liquidity pools

![background](/img/usecase/section-points.svg)

Risk of regulatory non-compliance without audit trails and transaction monitoring

![background](/img/usecase/section-points.svg)

Lack of real-time exchange rates and FX conversion for crypto/fiat pairs

![background](/img/usecase/section-points.svg)

Security and credential risks when integrating with external crypto services

![background](/img/usecase/section-points.svg)

Difficult to meet SLAs and uptime targets with homegrown data solutions
