#### Crypto Backtesting

### Backtest Crypto Strategies With Real Market Data

##### Most crypto backtesting tools use simplified OHLCV data that overlooks slippage, order book depth, and execution delays.

Without real historical crypto data and realistic fill simulation, your strategy's performance is just an illusion. True backtesting requires modeling actual market microstructure, not just price movements. When your backtesting engine can't access complete order book snapshots, accurate trade sequences, or realistic execution conditions, your strategy performance becomes purely fictional, leading to catastrophic losses when deployed live.

### What are the pain points when using crypto backtesting tools?

![background](/img/usecase/section-points.svg)

OHLCV-based crypto backtesting assumes perfect fills and ignores slippage, leading to wildly optimistic performance projections

![background](/img/usecase/section-points.svg)

No order book data means backtesting crypto strategies assumes unrealistic liquidity, missing the impact of market depth on execution.

![background](/img/usecase/section-points.svg)

Timestamp misalignment in historical crypto data introduces look-ahead bias - creating strategies that can't work in reality

![background](/img/usecase/section-points.svg)

Data gaps and inconsistent formats across exchanges make cross-venue strategy testing impossible

![background](/img/usecase/section-points.svg)

Most crypto backtesting platforms can't model exchange downtimes or API outages during critical market events

![background](/img/usecase/section-points.svg)

Survivorship bias from missing delisting and rebranding data skews long-term performance metrics

![background](/img/usecase/section-points.svg)

No access to true transaction costs per venue for algorithmic crypto trading leads to unrealistic profit calculations

How does CoinAPI solve these crypto backtesting issues?
