Learn How SingAlliance Utilizes Crypto API
to enhance its Cryptocurrency Investment Strategies and Data Analysis

### About Singalliance

SingAlliance offers an advanced platform for cryptocurrency investors who demand the best trading expertise. The company executes thousands of transactions with emphasis on security, high availability, and low latency. Their trading strategy includes adept management of price volatility. To gain better insights into the market, SingAlliance uses CoinAPI, a tool for analyzing and investing in cryptocurrencies. This enables SingAlliance to enhance profits for their customers.

> ***SingAlliance CEO quote: "Adopting CoinAPI was arguably the biggest step we were able to take in moving forward with quantitative research to produce new trading methods for our customers. CoinAPI offers an easy way to gather live data on any cryptocurrency and the trading volume of each of them. We use CoinAPI to power our portfolio tracking and research features"***

### SingAlliance: Pioneering Cryptocurrency Asset Management with CoinAPI

The popularity of crypto assets is on the rise, and investors are keen to diversify their portfolios with them. Cryptocurrency management platforms and tools have made it easier for investors to profit from these assets without worrying about the technicalities. The retail industry has recognized the potential of cryptocurrencies, resulting in an increase in funding opportunities.  
  
SingAlliance, established in Singapore in 2011, is an expert in managing crypto operations and assists companies in investing in high-performing assets across exchanges. With offices located in Singapore, Geneva, Hong Kong, and Dubai, SingAlliance provides comprehensive financial solutions and expert guidance to high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients while managing investment funds with high added value.

> ***"The market for financial solutions based on cryptocurrency is still new but is growing. Cryptocurrencies are now more extensively used in both the institutional and private sectors. As a result, we currently observe a significant demand from investors, particularly on the institutional side, which we satisfy with a reasonable and, most importantly, regulated offer. For many investors, cryptocurrency has evolved from a specialized product to a crucial part of their asset allocation." said Thierry Beck, SingAlliance CEO.***

Today, we had a conversation with Thierry Beck, the CEO of SingAlliance, to understand how they utilize CoinAPI to convert intricate aggregated cryptocurrency data into easily accessible data for their clients.

### The challenge

SingAlliance was looking for an API that provides historical data on cryptocurrencies to perform quantitative analysis for crypto investment. REST API access was the key factor in selecting the API vendor. SingAlliance utilizes CoinAPI to merge their traditional finance expertise with thorough research on cryptocurrencies. This enables them to offer customers active investment options in this emerging asset class.

> ***“At SingAlliance, we use CoinAPI to maintain and grow upon a portfolio of cryptocurrencies. We made a decision to integrate with CoinAPI because they offer the most comprehensive data available online. With access to more than 200 exchanges, our team can easily maintain and update information on multiple assets. The ability to store cryptocurrency transactions offline in the volatile market showed us that CoinAPI had our back. It is critical for us as an organization to have access to this type of data in order to make informed decisions. This is why we chose CoinAPI over other options on the market” explains SingAlliance CEO Thierry Beck.***

### Here are the challenges SingAlliance faced

### The solution

REST API access was the key factor in selecting the API vendor. SingAlliance utilizes CoinAPI to merge their traditional finance expertise with thorough research on cryptocurrencies. This enables them to offer customers active investment options in this emerging asset class.
