### Trident Trust Equips Crypto Fund Clients with Faster, More Accurate Data Through CoinAPI

Trident Trust automated their crypto fund NAV calculations using CoinAPI's price data API, reducing manual pricing work from hours to seconds while improving accuracy and auditor confidence across $10+ billion in digital assets.

**As a leading crypto fund administrator, Trident Trust needed a faster, more accurate way to calculate daily NAVs across hundreds of digital assets. At one point, manual data sourcing was no longer scalable. Thatâ€™s why they turned to CoinAPIâ€™s crypto price API to automate reporting and boost auditor trust.**

For over 40 years, [Trident Trust](https://www.tridenttrust.com/), has been known as a global leader, providing trusted fiduciary, corporate, and fund administration services to international financial companies and professional firms. Their global team supports over 700 alternative asset funds worldwide - from new, up-and-coming managers to multi-billion-dollar giants. This trust is built on a powerful mix of deep industry knowledge, modern technology, and a strong promise of personal service and long-term relationships.

Trident Trust was among the first fund administrators to embrace digital assets and has become a leading global crypto fund administrator as a result. Because they started early, they gained a deep understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities in the crypto space. Today, their award-winning specialist team supports more than $10 billion in digital assets. Their leadership is regularly recognized by the industry with numerous awards as they continue to innovate for clients and expand into new frontiers like tokenized funds.

### **The Challenge: Manual retrieval of crypto spot prices was slowing the NAV Calculation**

Before using CoinAPI, Trident Trust retrieved daily cryptocurrency spot prices manually from multiple sources â€” a time-consuming process that also introduced operational risk. For a fund administrator, pricing underlying assets accurately is mission-critical. With some clients trading a high volume of cryptocurrencies, automating this process became essential not just for speed, but for risk reduction and audit confidence.

At the heart of fund administration lies the **Net Asset Value (NAV) calculation**. The NAV is essentially the fund's official "price tag" for a single day, representing the value of one share of the fund. Itâ€™s calculated by taking the total value of all assets (like cryptocurrencies), subtracting all liabilities (like expenses), and dividing by the number of shares. This single number is crucial because it determines the price at which investors buy into or sell out of the fund and is the primary measure of the fund's performance.

For a digital asset fund, the most important and, at the same time, the most difficult part of this calculation is getting the price of each cryptocurrency right. With markets that never sleep and prices that change every second, finding an accurate, reliable daily closing price is a major challenge. Before using CoinAPI, the Trident Trust team manually sourced these from different platforms.

This manual process had two main problem areas:

* **It was slower and inefficient:** Team members spent hours just collecting the raw data they needed. This was a significant operational drain, especially for funds holding a large and diverse portfolio of tokens.
* **It created risk:** Manually calculating the NAV with prices pulled from various places opened the door to inconsistencies and potential errors. For a number that auditors scrutinize and investors depend on, this was a risk that needed to be eliminated.

To serve their clients better, Trident Trust knew they needed to automate this process with a single, trusted source of data.

### **The Solution: How CoinAPIâ€™s crypto price API automated NAVs**

Trident Trustâ€™s search for a data provider was made simple when one of their main crypto fund clients recommended CoinAPI. After reviewing the service, it was clear that CoinAPI was the right choice. It met all of their key requirements:

* **Wide Market Coverage:** CoinAPI provided data for a huge number of cryptocurrencies, including the smaller-cap tokens that some of their clients trade.
* **Access to Historical Data:** The ability to pull prices from specific past dates is essential for calculating NAVs correctly, as required by a fund's official documents.
* **Data Reliability:** Most importantly, the data had to be accurate and trustworthy. CoinAPI provided the confidence the team needed, both for their work and for the fundsâ€™ auditors.

The Trident Trust team used C# on .NET to connect with CoinAPI's historical price data feed. The new, automated system transformed their workflow. A task that used to take hours of manual work was now done with the "click of a button." The team can now download hundreds of daily crypto prices in just a couple of seconds. This automation has dramatically improved the efficiency of calculating the NAV.

Beyond speed, the accuracy of the data has given both the Trident Trust team and their clientsâ€™ auditors extra confidence in the pricing. This allows Trident Trust to better serve its most demanding clients and strengthen its position as a top-tier administrator in the digital asset space.

The work with Trident Trust shows how even complex fund administration workflows can be streamlined with a reliable cryptocurrency data API.
