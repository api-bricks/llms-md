### About Satstreet

[**Satstreet**](https://satstreet.com/) is a leading player in the rapidly growing digital asset industry. It offers its customers a highly reliable and liquid over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk, which provides real-time pricing data to help them make quick and informed decisions. Satstreet relies on CoinAPI to ensure that its pricing information is always up-to-date and accurate, saving its customers the hassle of manually searching for the latest prices.

At Satstreet, customers can trust that they are getting a personalized trading experience that caters to their unique needs. The OTC trading desk provides access to large liquidity pools that can handle big orders, as well as real-time pricing and market information, and dedicated customer service. Additionally, customers can enjoy competitive rates for their orders, enabling them to trade at the most favorable prices. This makes Satstreet a safe and cost-effective option for customers who need to complete large orders without causing market disruption.

To ensure the best possible trade execution services and reliable reporting, Satstreet relies on a live pricing service that aggregates and serves data through an API. That's why the company decided to use CoinAPI. To learn more about how Satstreet uses CoinAPI to turn complex aggregated crypto data into accessible information for its customers, we spoke with Satstreet co-founder Mike Nasser.

### The challenge

Satstreet was in search of a trustworthy and efficient provider for pricing services that could help their clients trade with confidence. They found the perfect solution in CoinAPI's live pricing and charting library. By integrating with Satstreet, CoinAPI was able to deliver live prices pre-quote, which boosted Satstreet's clients' confidence in trading with tight pricing.

> ***'From the start, our mission was to make the purchase, exchange, and sale of cryptocurrencies simpler and more reliable for Canadians. We have been devoted to servicing premium customers (accredited and approved investors) which has enabled us to offer an extraordinary 'white-glove service' that can't be found in Canada. In the past two years, we have grown rapidly, largely due to the importance we place on client service which has consequently resulted in mostly organic growth through word-of-mouth.'***¬†***explains Satstreet Co-Founder Mike Nasser.***

### Here are the challenges Satstreet faced:

#### **Lack of reliable price data**

Satstreet faced a major challenge in finding a market data API that could provide them with real-time and historical data for cryptocurrencies instantly. They needed access to streaming market data, rather than being restricted to pulling data in minute or daily intervals.

#### **Lack of real-time crypto prices**

Satstreet had to find a data provider to fill the gap in real-time cryptocurrency data that they were facing. This data was essential for them to integrate it into their charting system without any hassle.

#### **Work with the corporate entity and corporate-grade solution**

Satstreet was looking for a corporate partner who shares their vision and objectives. The goal was to strengthen their services by receiving the required resources and support to improve their solutions. A partnership with a corporate entity ensures that their solutions are trustworthy, secure, and regularly updated, which creates trust among their customers.

#### **Lack of multiple price sources**

The challenge of lacking multiple price sources was a significant one for Satstreet. They needed a dependable source capable of providing comprehensive cryptocurrency data from numerous exchanges, all consolidated into one accessible location.

### The solution

Satstreet needed a reliable stream of real-time crypto prices to keep pace with the constantly changing market. This was an essential requirement for their trading desk, which was not available earlier. By having access to live costs, their customers can trade with confidence, knowing that they are getting accurate prices.
