### Providing Relevant Data for Institutional Digital Asset Trading Solutions

Discover How Wyden Leverages CoinAPI’s Real-Time Market Data to Power Institutional-Grade Digital Asset Trading.

About Wyden
-----------

Wyden empowers banks and brokers to build and maintain retail and institutional digital asset client offerings as well as support internal proprietary trading needs via a single platform that covers the entire end-to-end trading lifecycle of digital assets across all pre-trade, trading, and post-trade requirements.

A key compliance advantage is that the Wyden platform offers true best execution through market-wide connectivity to over 55 trading venues and a smart order routing system that carries out price comparisons and order splitting to achieve the optimal execution terms.

Pre-trade risk and treasury management, coupled with post-trade settlement, reconciliation, and double-entry accounting, allows Wyden’s clients to build and offer retail and institutional products and comply with the requirements of both MiCA and DORA.

*Wyden serves as the core of the digital asset trade lifecycle ecosystem.*

**The Challenge**
-----------------

For its institutional-grade digital asset trade lifecycle infrastructure, Wyden was in search of a dependable market data solution to include more price information for certain currency pairs as well as additional conversion rates for specific calculations.

**In particular, Wyden wanted:**

* **Enhanced access to less common currency pairs**
* **Complete price data to further improve Wyden's internal calculations and workflows**
* **Reliable market data to test new features**

In crypto markets where timing is critical, addressing these data challenges enables quicker trades, improved strategic choices, and enhanced client satisfaction.

**Finding the Right Solution**
------------------------------

Wyden was searching for a market data solution to provide complete, accurate, and up-to-date information to help optimize their platform. When looking for such a provider, Wyden knew exactly what they needed:

* Extensive instrument coverage, including rare currency pairs and broader asset classes.
* A dependable, high-performance tool for handling real-time requests without latency issues.
* Both real-time updates through WebSocket and on-demand information through REST API
* Flexibility to scale as their platform grew in scope and complexity.

CoinAPI met Wyden's requirements by delivering precise market data across more than 370 exchanges. Our service provides both real-time and historical information through a dual-interface system of WebSocket and REST APIs that align perfectly with Wyden's specifications.

CoinAPI’s coverage across spot, futures, and options markets provided the depth necessary for sophisticated strategies, while maintaining consistent data quality across all integrated venues.

**The Technical Implementation Process**
----------------------------------------

Wyden’s development team built a Java-based connection to CoinAPI with a focus on maximizing the use of CoinAPI's WebSocket API for real-time market data streaming.

The implementation centered on two main areas:

* **Real-Time Data:** The team set up WebSocket feeds to track price movements for key currency pairs, cutting down latency where it mattered most
* **Backup REST Access:** When historical data or conversion rates were needed, the team tapped into CoinAPI's REST endpoints

**The Impact**
--------------

Adding CoinAPI's data streams transformed Wyden's development cycle. Real market data helped:

* Spot issues earlier,
* Cut testing time,
* Further boost confidence in new releases.

Time spent validating trade calculations dropped significantly while feature rollouts became more predictable.

> *"Reliable and comprehensive data delivery is paramount, particularly during high market volatility, while API performance should demonstrate consistently low latency and high uptime with flexibility for both real-time and historical data access. Besides, data providers must ensure to offer well-documented APIs with clear technical guidance to simplify implementation."
