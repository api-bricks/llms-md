### Native Token

A native token is the primary cryptocurrency or digital asset that's inherently built into and used by a specific blockchain network - for example, ETH is the native token of Ethereum.

What Is a Native Token?
-----------------------

A native token is the primary digital asset and currency of a specific blockchain. It is essential for the [blockchainâ€™s](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/blockchain) operations. Native tokens facilitate transactions and pay for [transaction fees](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/transaction-fees). They also reward miners or validators who secure the blockchain. Unlike non-native tokens, native tokens are integral to the blockchainâ€™s core functions.

Examples of Native Tokens
-------------------------

Prominent native tokens include Bitcoin (BTC) on the Bitcoin blockchain, Ether (ETH) on Ethereum, Binance Coin (BNB) on Binance Smart Chain, ADA on Cardano, and SOL on Solana. Each of these native tokens serves as the original token for its respective blockchain, playing a foundational role in its ecosystem. Additionally, USDC is a stablecoin native to multiple blockchains such as Ethereum, Solana, and Algorand. **These tokens store value and act as a medium of exchange**, similar to traditional currencies.

Native vs. Non-Native Tokens
----------------------------

Native tokens are created directly on their respective blockchains. They are essential for the blockchain's operations. In contrast, non-native tokens are created on platforms built atop the blockchain. For example, Uniswap's UNI token is created on Ethereum but is considered non-native. Non-native tokens often follow standards like ERC20, allowing interoperability within [decentralized applications (dApps).](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/daap)

Transaction Fees and Smart Contracts
------------------------------------

Transaction fees are a crucial aspect of blockchain networks, and native tokens play a vital role in paying for these fees. In most blockchain networks, transaction fees are paid in the native token of the network. For example, on the Ethereum blockchain, transaction fees are paid in Ether (ETH), while on the Bitcoin blockchain, transaction fees are paid in Bitcoin (BTC).

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code. They are a key feature of blockchain networks and are often used to automate various processes, such as the transfer of assets or the execution of specific rules. Smart contracts can be used to create complex logic for token creation, management, and transfer.

In the context of native tokens, smart contracts can be used to create custom tokens that are specific to a particular application or use case. These tokens can be used to represent a wide range of assets, such as digital collectibles, utility tokens, or even fiat currencies. Smart contracts can also be used to manage the supply of native tokens, ensuring that the total supply is capped and that new tokens are minted according to a predetermined schedule.

Token Creation and Management
-----------------------------

Token creation and management are critical aspects of blockchain networks, and native tokens are no exception. Native tokens are created through a process called minting, which involves the creation of new tokens according to a predetermined schedule or set of rules. The minting process is typically controlled by a smart contract, which ensures that the total supply of tokens is capped and that new tokens are created according to the rules defined in the contract.

Token management involves the administration of the token supply, including the distribution of tokens to users, the management of token balances, and the enforcement of rules governing token transfer and usage. Native tokens can be managed through a variety of mechanisms, including smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and [centralized exchanges](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/centralized-exchange-cex).

In the context of native tokens, token creation and management are critical for ensuring the integrity and security of the blockchain network. By controlling the supply of native tokens and enforcing rules governing their use, blockchain networks can ensure that transactions are secure, transparent, and tamper-proof.

In summary, native tokens are a critical component of blockchain networks, and their creation and management are essential for ensuring the integrity and security of the network. Through the use of smart contracts and decentralized applications, native tokens can be created, managed, and transferred in a secure and transparent manner, enabling a wide range of use cases and applications.

Importance of Native Tokens
---------------------------

Native tokens are crucial for the security and functionality of their blockchains, including paying transaction fees. They are used to pay for transaction fees, incentivizing miners and validators to process transactions. Additionally, native tokens serve as collateral in [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance) applications. Their intrinsic value and utility support the stability and growth of the blockchain ecosystem.

Native Tokens and Forks
-----------------------

When a blockchain undergoes a [hard fork](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/hard-fork), a new blockchain and its native token are created. These forked tokens are native to the new blockchain. For example, if Bitcoin forks to create Bitcoin Cash (BCH), the BCH token is native to Bitcoin Cash. **This ensures each blockchain maintains its own set of native tokens**, preserving the integrity of each network.

Use Cases and Applications
--------------------------

Native tokens power a wide range of applications within their blockchain ecosystems. In addition to native tokens, other tokens created on the blockchain can also be used for various applications. They are used for everyday transactions and paying for smart contract execution. Native tokens also serve as incentives for network participants who validate and secure the blockchain. In decentralized applications (dApps), they act as the primary currency for transactions, governance, and accessing specific features. **In DeFi, native tokens enable lending, borrowing, and trading without intermediaries.**

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Definition of Native Tokens**: Native tokens are the primary digital currencies inherent to their specific blockchains, essential for enabling transactions, paying fees, and maintaining network operations. They form the core foundation of their respective blockchain ecosystems.
* **Key Examples**: Prominent native tokens include Bitcoin (BTC) for the Bitcoin blockchain, Ether (ETH) for Ethereum, and ADA for Cardano. These tokens are designed to store value and facilitate exchanges within their networks.
* **Native vs. Non-Native Tokens**: Unlike native tokens, non-native tokens are created on top of existing blockchains and are not essential to the core functionality. Non-native tokens often follow specific standards like ERC20, allowing them to be used across various decentralized applications.
* **Importance and Use Cases**: Native tokens are vital for transaction fees, incentivizing validators, and serving as collateral in DeFi applications. They ensure the security, stability, and growth of the blockchain by providing the necessary economic incentives for network participation.
