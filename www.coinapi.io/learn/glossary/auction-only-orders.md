Auction-Only Orders - Definition
================================

An Auction-Only Order is a specialized trading instruction. **It allows participants to engage exclusively during designated auction periods** on a trading venue, such as a cryptocurrency or stock exchange.

Unlike regular orders that interact with the continuous [order book](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/order-book), Auction-Only Orders are activated solely during specific auction phases. This ensures that trades are executed within these structured price discovery events.

Activation and States
---------------------

**Auction-Only Orders become active only during specific instrument states**: Opening Auction, Opening Auction Freeze, Intraday Auction, Intraday Auction Freeze, Closing Auction, and Closing Auction Freeze. Outside these states, the orders remain inactive.

They can be entered, modified, or deleted but will not participate in the regular [order matching](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/order-matching-algorithms) process or influence the published market data. When an instrument transitions into an auction state, all Auction-Only Orders are automatically activated.

Order Types and Validation
--------------------------

Auction-Only Orders can be either [market orders](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/market-order) or [limit orders](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/limit-order). **Notably, these orders bypass certain validation mechanisms**. Specifically, they skip the Price/Reasonability Check and the Extended Price Range Validation.

Execution and Lifecycle
-----------------------

**During an auction state, Auction-Only Orders function like regular orders**. They participate fully in the matching process to help determine the auction price. If an Auction-Only Order remains unexecuted after the auction concludes, it does not get deleted automatically. Instead, the order transitions to an inactive state.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Exclusive Participation**: Auction-only orders are only active during designated auction periods. This ensures that trades are executed within structured price discovery events rather than during continuous trading.
* **Order Flexibility**: These orders can be either market or limit orders and bypass certain validation checks. This allows for quicker and more flexible participation in auctions.
* **Activation Mechanism**: Auction-only orders remain inactive outside auction states. They automatically activate and receive a new priority timestamp when an auction phase begins. This integrates them seamlessly with regular orders.
* **Lifecycle Management**: Unexecuted Auction-Only Orders after an auction do not get deleted. They become inactive, preventing interference with ongoing trading activities outside of auctions.
