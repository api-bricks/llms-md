Definition of Level 1 Data
--------------------------

Level 1 Data refers to the most basic type of market data available to traders and investors. It includes real-time [**quotes**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/quotes) for the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO). These quotes are for a particular security. They display the highest price a buyer is willing to pay (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept (ask). This data typically also includes the trading volume at these bid and ask prices. It provides a snapshot of the current market sentiment and price.

How Level 1 Data Works
----------------------

**Level 1 Data** operates by aggregating and displaying the best available bid and ask prices from the market. It provides essential information that reflects the most immediate supply and demand for security. Investors use this data to make informed decisions about buying and selling. It shows the current price points where transactions are most likely to occur. This [**real-time data**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/real-time-data) is accessible through various platforms. These include brokers' websites and financial news portals. Often, it is available at no cost to the user.

When to Use Level 1 Data
------------------------

Level 1 Data is particularly useful for long-term investors. They are less concerned with minute-to-minute price fluctuations. They focus more on overall market trends. By providing the best bid and ask prices, along with corresponding volumes, investors can gauge the immediate [**liquidity**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/liquidity) and potential price movements of a stock. For example, an investor looking to buy shares can use Level 1 quotes to determine if their order will be filled at the current price. Alternatively, they might need to set a [**limit order**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/limit-order) to achieve a better price.

Accessibility of Level 1 Data
-----------------------------

Level 1 Data has become widely accessible to individual investors with the rise of online trading platforms and financial information services. Unlike higher-level data, which may require subscriptions or additional fees, Level 1 quotes are often available for free. They are accessible through brokerage accounts, financial news websites, and specialized financial APIs like those provided by CoinAPI. This accessibility democratizes market data. It enables a broader range of investors to make informed trading decisions without incurring additional costs.

Comparison with Higher-Level Data
---------------------------------

**Level 1 Data** offers fundamental insights into the market. It is often sufficient for long-term investors. Active traders, however, may require more detailed information. They can access [Level 2 Data](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/level-2-data) or [Level 3 Data](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/level-3-data).

**Level 2 Data** provides [market depth](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/market-depth). It shows multiple bid and ask levels, giving a clearer picture of supply and demand at various price points.

**Level 3 Data** goes further by displaying individual orders from [market makers](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/market-maker). This allows for more precise trading strategies. Understanding the differences between these levels helps investors choose the right data tier for their specific trading needs.

Benefits for Traders
--------------------

**Level 1 Data** provides several key benefits for traders:

* **Real-Time Information:** Immediate access to the best bid and ask prices enables quick decision-making.
* **Liquidity Assessment:** Understanding the current bid and ask sizes helps evaluate the liquidity of a security.
* **Price Discovery:** Facilitates the identification of fair market prices based on current supply and demand.
* **Cost Efficiency:** Often available for free, reducing barriers to accessing essential market data.

These benefits make **Level 1 Data** a valuable tool for both novice and experienced traders aiming to optimize their trading strategies and enhance market participation.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Essential Market Snapshot:** Level 1 Data provides real-time quotes for the best bid and ask prices, along with trading volumes, offering a clear snapshot of current market conditions.
* **Informed Decision-Making:** By reflecting immediate supply and demand, Level 1 Data enables investors to make informed buying and selling decisions based on the most current market information.
* **Wide Accessibility:** Unlike more detailed data levels, Level 1 Data is widely accessible and often free, making it an invaluable resource for individual investors and traders.
* **Foundation for Trading Strategies:** Understanding Level 1 Data is fundamental for various trading strategies, whether for long-term investment or active trading. It serves as the basis for utilizing more advanced market data when needed.
