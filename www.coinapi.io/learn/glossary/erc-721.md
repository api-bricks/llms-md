ERC-721 - Definition
====================

**ERC-721** is a technical standard on the **Ethereum** blockchain for creating **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**. Unlike fungible tokens such as ERC-20, where each token is identical and interchangeable, ERC-721 tokens are unique and indivisible. They represent ownership of distinct digital or physical assets.

Key Features of ERC-721
-----------------------

ERC-721 tokens have several key characteristics:

* **Uniqueness:** Each token has a unique identifier that distinguishes it from others.
* **Ownership Tracking:** The standard ensures a secure and transparent record of ownership on the Ethereum blockchain.
* **Metadata Storage:** Tokens can store metadata like images and descriptions, enhancing their uniqueness.
* **Interoperability:** ERC-721 tokens work with various decentralized applications that support the standard.
* **Standard Functions:** Includes functions such as `transferFrom()`, `ownerOf()`, `balanceOf()`, `approve()`, and `getApproved()` for managing tokens.

How ERC-721 Works
-----------------

ERC-721 operates through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts define functions to create, transfer, and manage NFTs. Each token is linked to a unique `tokenId` and contract address, forming a globally unique identifier. This standard ensures that tokens can be tracked individually, preventing duplication or division.

Use Cases of ERC-721
--------------------

ERC-721 is used in various industries:

* **Digital Art:** Artists create unique digital artworks as NFTs, verifying authenticity and ownership.
* **Gaming:** In-game assets like characters and items are tokenized, allowing players to own and trade them permanently.
* **Collectibles:** Digital collectibles such as trading cards leverage ERC-721 to maintain uniqueness.
* **Virtual Real Estate:** Virtual worlds use ERC-721 to represent ownership of virtual land and properties.
* **Certificates and Tickets:** ERC-721 tokens can serve as digital certificates or event tickets, ensuring verifiable ownership.

History and Origins
-------------------

William Entriken, Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans, and Nastassia Sachs proposed the ERC-721 standard in January 2018. It was developed to overcome the limitations of the ERC-20 standard, which is unsuitable for representing unique assets.

The success of projects like CryptoKitties showed the potential of non-fungible tokens, leading to the widespread adoption of ERC-721.

Technical Specification
-----------------------

ERC-721 defines mandatory and optional functions that a smart contract must implement to comply with the standard:

### Mandatory Functions

* `balanceOf(address _owner)`: Returns the number of tokens owned by an address.
* `ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId)`: Returns the owner of a specific token.
* `transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId)`: Transfers ownership of a token.
* `approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId)`: Approves another address to transfer a specific token.
* `getApproved(uint256 _tokenId)`: Returns the approved address for a token.

### Optional Extensions

* **Metadata Extension (`ERC721Metadata`):** Allows tokens to have additional metadata like name, description, and image URI.
* **Enumerable Extension (`ERC721Enumerable`):** Enables enumerating all tokens in the contract and tokens owned by a particular address.

ERC-721 vs. ERC-20
------------------

The primary difference between ERC-721 and ERC-20 is fungibility:

* **ERC-20 Tokens:** Fungible. Each token is identical and interchangeable. Ideal for cryptocurrencies and utility tokens.
* **ERC-721 Tokens:** Non-fungible. Each token is unique and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis. Suitable for digital collectibles and unique assets.

Additionally, ERC-20 supports fractional ownership through decimals, while ERC-721 tokens are indivisible.

Advantages and Disadvantages
----------------------------

### Advantages

* **Uniqueness:** Each token is distinct, providing true ownership of unique assets.
* **Transparency:** Ownership and transaction history are recorded on the blockchain.
* **Interoperability:** Compatible with various decentralized applications and marketplaces.
* **Digital Provenance:** Facilitates verification of the authenticity and origin of digital assets.

### Disadvantages

* **High Transaction Fees:** Ethereum network congestion can lead to expensive gas fees.
* **Scalability Issues:** Ethereum's scalability is limited, affecting transaction speed and costs.
* **Complexity:** Developing ERC-721 contracts requires advanced technical knowledge.
* **Market Volatility:** The NFT market can be highly speculative and volatile, posing investment risks.

Notable Implementations and Projects
------------------------------------

Several projects utilize the ERC-721 standard:

* **CryptoKitties:** One of the first and most popular NFT projects, allowing users to breed and trade unique digital cats.
* **Decentraland:** A virtual world where users can buy, sell, and trade virtual land using ERC-721 tokens.
* **OpenSea:** The largest NFT marketplace, supporting various ERC-721 tokens for various digital assets.
* **Bored Ape Yacht Club:** A collection of 10,000 unique ape-themed NFTs that also serve as membership tokens to an exclusive club.
* **SuperRare:** A digital art platform where artists can tokenize and sell their unique artworks as ERC-721 NFTs.

Future Prospects
----------------

ERC-721 continues to evolve with developments aimed at enhancing scalability and reducing transaction costs. Innovations like Ethereum 2.0 and cross-chain solutions are expected to address current limitations. These advancements will foster broader adoption and enable more diverse applications of non-fungible tokens.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Unique Standard:** ERC-721 is the foundational standard for creating non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring each token is distinct and indivisible.
* **Comprehensive Features:** It offers essential functionalities like ownership tracking, metadata storage, and interoperability with various decentralized applications.
* **Wide-ranging Applications:** ERC-721 is utilized in sectors including digital art, gaming, virtual real estate, and collectibles, enabling secure ownership and seamless trading of unique items.
* **Pros and Cons:** While ERC-721 provides transparency, digital provenance, and interoperability, it also faces challenges such as high transaction fees, scalability issues, and market volatility.
* **Evolving Landscape:** Ongoing advancements like Ethereum 2.0 and layer 2 solutions are enhancing the ERC-721 standard, aiming to improve scalability, reduce costs, and expand its applicability in the blockchain ecosystem.
