Fill Or Kill (FOK) Order - Definition
=====================================

A **Fill Or Kill (FOK)** order is a specialized type of [Time In Force (TIF)](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/time-in-force-tif) order used in trades. It requires that a [Trade Execution](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/trade-execution) be completed immediately and entirely at a specified price. If the full order cannot be executed, it is canceled. This all-or-nothing approach prevents large trades from being partially filled. Partial fills could disrupt market prices or lead to incomplete investment strategies. FOK orders are preferred by active traders handling large quantities of stock. They provide certainty and control over significant trades.

How Fill Or Kill Orders Work
----------------------------

When a trader places a FOK order, the brokerage must execute the entire order right away at the specified price or better. If the full quantity is not available immediately, the order is canceled. This ensures that the trader does not receive a partial fill.

Partial fills could impact the desired outcome of the Trade Execution. FOK orders combine the rules of [Immediate Or Cancel (IOC)](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/immediate-or-cancel) orders. They provide a strict execution framework focused on completeness and immediacy.

Practical Applications of FOK Orders
------------------------------------

FOK orders are useful in high-volume trading environments. Executing large orders quickly and completely is crucial here. For example, an investor who wants to buy or sell any shares at a specific price uses a FOK order. This ensures the entire transaction is completed without adversely affecting the market price.

This is important in volatile markets. Partial fills could lead to unfavorable price movements or missed opportunities. FOK orders are also beneficial when trading across multiple markets at the same time. They ensure the entire order is executed uniformly without manual intervention.

When to Use a Fill or Kill Order
--------------------------------

Traders should use FOK orders when full execution of a large transaction is essential. This includes:

* **High-Volume Trades**: Trading large blocks of securities where partial execution could lead to strategic disadvantages or increased costs.
* **Volatile Markets**: In fast-moving markets where prices change rapidly. Immediate and complete execution helps avoid slippage.
* **Strategic Transactions**: Implementing trading strategies that rely on the full scale of the transaction.
* **Cross-Market Trades**: Executing trades across multiple exchanges simultaneously to ensure consistency and avoid manual cancellations.

Using FOK orders in these situations maintains trading efficiency and reduces the risk of unfavorable executions.

Example of a Fill or Kill Order
-------------------------------

Suppose an investor wants to buy 1 million shares of Stock XYZ at $15 per share. By placing an FOK order, the investor ensures that either all 1 million shares are bought immediately at $15 or better, or the order is canceled. If the brokerage can only provide 700,000 shares at $15, the FOK order is canceled.

However, if the brokerage can fulfill the entire order at $15 or a lower price, the Trade Execution is completed instantly. This example shows how FOK orders provide precise control over large transactions. They prevent partial fills that could disrupt the investor's strategy.

Benefits of Using FOK Orders
----------------------------

FOK orders offer several advantages, especially for traders handling large volumes:

1. **Certainty of Execution**: Orders are either fully executed or not executed at all.
2. **Market Stability**: Reduces the risk of significant price movements caused by large, incomplete trades.
3. **Strategic Control**: Aligns with trading strategies that require precise execution without compromise.
4. **Efficiency**: Saves time by eliminating the need to cancel incomplete orders manually.

These benefits make FOK orders essential for traders needing reliability and precision in large-scale transactions.

Drawbacks of Fill Or Kill Orders
--------------------------------

While FOK orders provide control and certainty, they have limitations:

1. **Lower Execution Probability**: FOK orders require full execution immediately. They are less likely to be filled compared to more flexible order types like [Immediate Or Cancel](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/immediate-or-cancel).
2. **Market Impact**: Large FOK orders can still impact the market price if the order size is substantial relative to market liquidity.
3. **Opportunity Cost**: If a FOK order is canceled, the trader might miss potential trades that could have been partially filled.

Despite these drawbacks, FOK orders are valuable for traders who prioritize execution certainty over flexibility.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Immediate and Complete Execution**: FOK orders require the entire order to be executed instantly at the specified price. This prevents partial fills, maintaining strategic investment positions without unintended market exposure.
* **High-Volume and Strategic Use**: FOK orders are best suited for large trades where full execution is necessary. They help prevent market disruptions from incomplete transactions.
* **Comparison with Other Order Types**: Unlike All Or None (AON) and Immediate Or Cancel (IOC) orders, FOK orders do not allow partial executions. They offer greater certainty but less flexibility. Understanding these differences is key to selecting the appropriate order type.
* **Potential Drawbacks**: While providing execution certainty, FOK orders may result in lower fill rates and missed opportunities in fast-paced or less liquid markets. Traders must weigh these risks against the benefits when deciding to use FOK orders.
