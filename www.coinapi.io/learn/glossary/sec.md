The **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** is an independent federal agency of the United States government. It was established in 1934 after the 1929 stock market crash. Its primary mission is to protect investors, maintain fair and orderly markets, and facilitate capital formation. The SEC achieves these goals by enforcing federal securities laws. It also regulates the securities industry and oversees key market participants.

### Mission and Objectives

The SEC operates with a three-part mission:

1. **Protect Investors:** ensuring that investors have access to accurate and complete information necessary for making informed investment decisions.
2. **Maintain Fair, Orderly, and Efficient Markets:** promoting transparency and preventing fraudulent and manipulative practices within the securities markets.
3. **Facilitate Capital Formation:** enhancing the ability of businesses to raise capital efficiently while balancing investor protection.

### Organizational Structure

The SEC is headed by a five-member commission appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. No more than three commissioners can belong to the same political party. This ensures bipartisan leadership. The commission includes a Chair and four other commissioners. Each serves five-year terms with the possibility of an additional 18 months of service.

The agency is divided into five main divisions:

* **Division of Corporate Finance:** oversees financial disclosures by public companies.
* **Division of Enforcement:** investigates and takes legal action against violations of securities laws.
* **Division of Investment Management:** regulates investment companies and advisors.
* **Division of Economic and Risk Analysis:** provides economic and data analytics to support SEC activities.
* **Division of Trading and Markets:** establishes standards for fair and efficient trading practices.

### Key Functions and Responsibilities

#### Regulation and Oversight

The SEC regulates securities markets, including stock exchanges, brokerage firms, and investment advisors. All securities offered in the U.S. must be registered with the SEC before being sold to investors. Financial services firms such as broker-dealers and asset managers must also register with the SEC to operate legally.

#### Enforcement of Securities Laws

The SEC enforces securities laws through civil actions in federal court and administrative proceedings. It investigates fraudulent activities, insider trading, accounting fraud, and market manipulation. Successful enforcement actions can result in fines, injunctions, disgorgement of illegal profits, and bans from the securities industry.

#### Rulemaking and Regulation Development

The SEC develops and implements regulations that govern the securities markets. This process typically begins with a concept release, followed by proposals and public comments, before finalizing new rules. These regulations aim to enhance market transparency, protect investors, and ensure the integrity of financial markets.

### Recent Developments

In recent years, the SEC has focused on emerging areas such as [cryptocurrency](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/cryptocurrency) regulation and cybersecurity [risk management](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/risk-management). In 2023, the SEC intensified its scrutiny of major cryptocurrency exchanges. It filed charges against entities like Binance and Coinbase for operating without proper registration. Additionally, the SEC adopted the Cybersecurity Risk Management rule in 2023. This rule encourages transparent management of cybersecurity risks by public companies.

### Historical Context

The SEC was established by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to restore investor confidence following the Great Depression. Over the decades, it has expanded its regulatory scope in response to evolving financial markets and legislative actions. This includes the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which significantly increased the SEC's authority in supervising financial institutions and enforcing securities laws.

### Relationship with Other Agencies

The SEC collaborates with other regulatory bodies such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It also works with international securities agencies. Additionally, the SEC partners with law enforcement agencies like the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Together, they enforce securities laws and prosecute financial crimes.
