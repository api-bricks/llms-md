### Miner Extractable Value (MEV)

Miner Extractable Value (MEV) is an important concept in blockchain systems, particularly Ethereum. It refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block rewards and gas fees by including, excluding, or reordering transactions within a block.

MEV - Definition
----------------

Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) represents the highest potential profit that a [blockchain](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/blockchain) miner, validator, or sequencer can achieve by manipulating the inclusion, exclusion, or order of transactions within a block during the block production process. Originally known as Miner Extractable Value, the term has evolved to include all types of block producers across different consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and other network protocols. MEV allows those controlling block construction to reorder transactions to maximize their revenue. This often results in disadvantages for regular users.

How MEV Works
-------------

MEV arises from the ability of block producers to control the order and inclusion of transactions within a block. When users submit transactions to the network, these transactions are placed in a mempool, a pool of pending transactions. Block producers select transactions from the mempool to include in the next block. They typically prioritize those with higher gas fees to maximize their profits. However, beyond ordering by fee, block producers can strategically reorder transactions to exploit profitable opportunities such as arbitrage, liquidation events, or frontrunning user trades. This manipulation allows them to extract additional value beyond standard block rewards.

Examples of MEV
---------------

### Frontrunning and Sandwich Attacks

Frontrunning involves bots monitoring the mempool for large transactions. They submit their own transactions with higher fees to execute before the detected transactions. This can lead to **sandwich attacks**, where the frontrunner places one transaction before and one after a user's transaction. By doing so, they manipulate the market price to their advantage. As a result, the user experiences higher slippage.

### Exchange Arbitrage and Liquidations

Arbitrage bots exploit price discrepancies across different [decentralized exchanges (DEXs)](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex). They swiftly buy low on one exchange and sell high on another. Similarly, during liquidation events in lending platforms, bots can trigger liquidations faster than others. This allows them to capture the liquidation rewards, often at the expense of the borrower.

### Generalized Frontrunning

Advanced bots engage in generalized frontrunning by scanning the mempool for profitable opportunities. They replace addresses in transaction payloads with their own and submit these transactions with higher fees. This ensures priority inclusion in blocks.

Pros and Cons
-------------

### Pros

* **Mitigating Economic Inefficiencies:** MEV can help stabilize DeFi protocols by enabling rapid liquidations and ensuring token prices across exchanges reflect true market demand. Arbitrage activities contributed by MEV enhance market efficiency and robustness.
* **Enhanced Network Security:** The competition among validators or miners to capture MEV opportunities incentivizes investment in network infrastructure, potentially enhancing overall security.

### Cons

* **Negative User Experience:** MEV can lead to higher transaction fees and increased slippage for users. This makes interactions with DEXs more costly and less predictable.
* **Potential Consensus Instability:** If MEV earnings surpass block rewards, block producers might be incentivized to reorganize past blocks to maximize profits. This undermines the network's consensus mechanism and overall integrity.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Definition of MEV:** Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) refers to the maximum profit that block producers can earn by strategically ordering, including, or excluding transactions within a block. This capability allows miners, validators, or sequencers to manipulate transaction flow for financial gain.
* **Origins and Evolution:** MEV emerged prominently with the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and was first detailed in the "Flash Boys 2.0" research paper. The concept has since expanded beyond traditional mining roles to include various consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Stake (PoS).
* **Mechanisms and Examples:** Block producers exploit MEV through tactics like frontrunning, sandwich attacks, arbitrage across exchanges, and triggering liquidations. These actions enable the extraction of additional value beyond standard block rewards, often at the expense of regular users.
* **Impact and Mitigation:** While MEV can enhance market efficiency and network security, it also poses risks like increased transaction costs and potential consensus instability. Mitigation strategies such as fair sequencing services and Layer 2 solutions are crucial for balancing MEV's benefits and drawbacks.
