### Token Standards

A token standard is a set of rules and functions that define how a token should behave on a blockchain. Think of it like a blueprint that ensures tokens work consistently and can interact with wallets, exchanges, and other applications reliably.

What Are Token Standards?
=========================

**[Token](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/token) standards** are predefined rules and protocols for creating and managing [cryptocurrency](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/cryptocurrency) tokens on a [blockchain](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/blockchain). They determine how tokens behave and interact within the ecosystem. These standards ensure consistent operation across platforms.

This consistency facilitates interoperability with [wallets](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/crypto-wallet), exchanges, and [decentralized applications (dApps)](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/daap). By following token standards, developers create universally recognized and supported tokens. This enhances their utility and adoption across the blockchain landscape.

Importance of Token Standards
-----------------------------

**Token standards** provide a common framework within the blockchain ecosystem. They ensure compatibility and interoperability between different tokens and platforms.

This uniformity allows efficient application development. Developers can rely on standardized interfaces and functionalities. Adhering to established token standards also enhances security.

These standards are thoroughly vetted and widely tested by the community. Overall, token standards foster innovation, reduce development time and promote a cohesive blockchain environment.

Common Token Standards
----------------------

### ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Comment 20)

**ERC-20** is the most widely adopted token standard on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines rules for [fungible tokens](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/fungible-token). Fungible tokens are identical and interchangeable. ERC-20 is ideal for creating cryptocurrencies, [utility tokens](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/utility-token), and [stablecoins](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/stablecoin).

The standard includes functions like transferring tokens, checking balances, and approving tokens for spending. Popular ERC-20 tokens include Maker (MKR), Basic Attention Token (BAT), and Uniswap (UNI).

### ERC-721

**ERC-721** is the standard for [non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/non-fungible-token) on Ethereum. Unlike ERC-20, each ERC-721 token is unique and indivisible. This makes them ideal for digital art, collectibles, gaming items, and other unique assets.

The standard enables distinct ownership and provenance. Creators can authenticate and trade one-of-a-kind digital assets seamlessly. Notable ERC-721 tokens include CryptoKitties and CryptoPunks.

### ERC-1155

**ERC-1155** is a versatile token standard supporting both fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single [smart contract](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/smart-contract). This standard enhances efficiency by allowing batch transfers of multiple token types. It reduces transaction costs and minimizes network congestion.

ERC-1155 is useful in gaming and digital asset environments where interchangeable and unique items coexist. Applications like Enjin use ERC-1155 to manage diverse asset types efficiently.

### BEP-20 (Binance Evolution Proposal 20)

**BEP-20** is the primary token standard for the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It mirrors Ethereum's ERC-20 but is optimized for the BSC ecosystem. BEP-20 tokens benefit from faster transactions and lower fees compared to Ethereum.

These tokens are suitable for various applications within the Binance ecosystem. They are widely used in [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance) platforms, gaming, and other dApps on BSC.

Token Standards on Other Blockchains
------------------------------------

### Tezos Token Standards (FA1.2 & FA2)

On the **Tezos blockchain**, FA1.2 and FA2 are the primary token standards. FA1.2 defines fungible tokens with basic functions like transfers and approvals, similar to Ethereum's ERC-20.

FA2 is a more advanced standard supporting various token types, including fungible, non-fungible, and multi-asset contracts, akin to ERC-1155. FA2 offers greater flexibility and efficiency for creating complex token systems within the Tezos ecosystem.

### Solana Token Standard (SPL)

**Solanaâ€™s SPL** (Solana Program Library) is the standard for creating and managing tokens on Solana. SPL tokens support both fungible and non-fungible types. They are designed for high-speed, low-cost transactions. This makes them ideal for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and scalable digital asset management.

The SPL standard ensures compatibility with Solana wallets and smart contracts, enabling seamless integration within the Solana ecosystem.

### NEO Token Standards (NEP-5, NEP-11, NEP-17)

The **NEO blockchain** uses several token standards: NEP-5 for fungible tokens, NEP-11 for non-fungible tokens, and NEP-17 as a general-purpose token standard. These standards provide a framework for creating and managing tokens on NEO.

They facilitate interoperability and integration with various dApps and services on the network. NEP standards ensure tokens function consistently and securely within the NEO ecosystem.

Benefits of Token Standards
---------------------------

Adopting **token standards** offers numerous benefits:

* **Compatibility:** Ensures tokens work seamlessly across platforms, wallets, and exchanges.
* **Interoperability:** Facilitates interaction between diverse tokens and blockchain applications.
* **Security:** Provides well-tested frameworks that reduce vulnerabilities.
* **Efficiency:** Streamlines development processes by leveraging existing standards.
* **Innovation:** Encourages the creation of diverse and complex token functionalities.

Practical Applications
----------------------

**Token standards** are integral to various blockchain applications:

* **Cryptocurrencies:** ERC-20 and BEP-20 enable the creation of digital currencies and stablecoins.
* **DeFi Platforms:** Facilitate decentralized financial services like lending, borrowing, and trading.
* **NFT Marketplaces:** ERC-721 and ERC-1155 support the creation and trading of unique digital assets.
* **Gaming:** ERC-1155 allows efficient management of in-game assets.
* **Real-World Asset Tokenization:** FA2 and ERC-4626 enable the representation of real-world assets on the blockchain.

Regulatory and Security Considerations
--------------------------------------

When creating and managing tokens, consider regulatory compliance and security. Different token types may be subject to varying regulations based on their use cases.

For example, security tokens representing equity or real estate must follow specific legal requirements. Additionally, the security of token smart contracts is crucial to prevent issues like unlimited minting or unauthorized transfers. Ensuring smart contracts are open-source and audited can mitigate risks and enhance token trustworthiness.

Future Developments in Token Standards
--------------------------------------

Token standards continue to evolve to address new needs and enhance functionality. Future developments include standards for asynchronous tokenized vaults (ERC-7540), streamlined KYC processes, and enhanced real-world asset tokenization.

These advancements aim to improve efficiency, security, and compliance. They further integrate blockchain technology with real-world applications. As the blockchain ecosystem grows, ongoing innovation in token standards will drive broader adoption and unlock new possibilities for decentralized finance and digital asset management.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Unified Framework:** Token standards provide consistent rules for cryptocurrency tokens. This ensures predictable behavior and seamless interaction across different blockchain platforms.
* **Enhanced Security and Interoperability:** Adhering to token standards enhances security with well-tested protocols. It also facilitates interoperability between various tokens and platforms.
* **Diverse Standards for Varied Needs:** Multiple token standards cater to different use cases, like ERC-20 for fungible tokens and ERC-721 for non-fungible tokens. This allows the creation of diverse digital assets.
* **Facilitates Innovation and Adoption:** Token standards provide a reliable foundation. They streamline development, encourage innovation, and promote broader blockchain adoption.
