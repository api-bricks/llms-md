### Rebase Token

A rebase token (also called an elastic token) is a cryptocurrency whose supply automatically adjusts (expands or contracts) to try to maintain a target price.

Rebase Token - Definition
=========================

A **Rebase Token**, also known as an elastic token, is a type of cryptocurrency with an elastic supply mechanism. It automatically adjusts its total supply based on specific rules or algorithms.

This dynamic adjustment aims to achieve targeted economic objectives, such as price stability or adherence to a predetermined monetary policy. This feature differentiates it from traditional tokens with fixed supplies.

### Key Characteristics

* **Elastic Supply:** Rebase tokens periodically increase (positive rebase) or decrease (negative rebase) their total supply. These adjustments are based on predefined conditions or market dynamics. This elasticity helps maintain the token's price relative to a target value.
* **Target Price or Metric:** The rebase mechanism typically aims to stabilize the token's price around a specific target or align it with certain economic indicators. For example, Ampleforth (AMPL) targets a price of approximately $1 per token.
* **Proportional Redistribution:** During a rebase event, all token holders experience a proportional change in their holdings. This ensures that individual ownership percentages remain consistent even as the total supply adjusts.
* **Algorithmic Control:** Smart contracts or decentralized algorithms govern the rebase process. This ensures transparency and adherence to established rules without the need for manual intervention.

### How Rebase Tokens Work

Rebase tokens adjust their supply in response to price fluctuations. For instance, if the market price of a rebase token like AMPL exceeds its target price, the protocol increases the supply. This dilutes each token's value to bring the price back down. Conversely, if the price falls below the target, the supply decreases. This increases the value of each token to stabilize the price.

This mechanism ensures that while the number of tokens in each wallet changes, the overall value of the holdings remains aligned with the target price. The adjustments are automated through smart contracts, which execute the rebase process based on real-time market data.

### Practical Applications

**Stablecoins:** Rebase tokens can maintain a stable value relative to fiat currencies or other assets by adjusting their supply in response to price changes. This offers an alternative to traditional stablecoins.

**DeFi Incentivization:** In decentralized finance platforms, rebase tokens can dynamically adjust rewards or penalties based on user participation metrics. This aligns with incentives and promotes platform engagement.

**Monetary Policy Experimentation:** Blockchain ecosystems can utilize rebase tokens to explore decentralized monetary policies. This offers a novel approach to managing digital economies.

### Benefits

* **Automated Price Stability:** Rebase tokens provide a mechanism to mitigate volatility. This makes them more reliable for transactions, and payments, and as a store of value.
* **Decentralization:** Operating on decentralized networks, rebase tokens reduce the risk of censorship and eliminate single points of failure.
* **Efficiency:** The automated rebase process eliminates the need for centralized control. This streamlines the maintenance of price stability.

### Risks

* **Price Instability:** Despite their mechanisms, rebase tokens can still experience significant price volatility, especially under extreme market conditions.
* **User Confusion:** The complex mechanics of rebase tokens can confuse users. This may lead to misunderstandings and financial losses.
* **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:** Flaws in the underlying smart contracts can result in unexpected behaviors or losses for token holders.
* **Regulatory Uncertainty:** The legal status and tax implications of rebase tokens are often unclear. This poses risks for both users and issuing projects.

### Tax Implications

The tax treatment of rebase tokens varies by jurisdiction and depends on the specific mechanisms of the token. Positive rebases, which increase token holdings, may be considered taxable income. Both positive and negative rebases can result in capital gains or losses. Users must maintain accurate records of rebase events and consult with tax professionals to ensure compliance with local regulations.

### Examples of Rebase Tokens

* **Ampleforth (AMPL):** Pioneered the rebase concept with a target price of around $1 per token.
* **OlympusDAO (OHM):** Utilizes rebase functions to distribute rewards to token holders.
* **Staked Ether (stETH):** Rebases daily to maintain price parity and distribute staking rewards.
* **Dogekiller (LEASH):** Originally tracked Dogecoin's price before transitioning to a store-of-value model.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Elastic Supply Mechanism:** Rebase tokens automatically adjust their total supply through positive or negative rebases to maintain price stability or meet other economic targets. This elasticity distinguishes them from traditional fixed-supply tokens.
* **Algorithmic Control and Transparency:** The rebase process is governed by smart contracts or decentralized algorithms. This ensures that supply adjustments are executed transparently and without the need for manual intervention.
* **Proportional Redistribution of Holdings:** During rebase events, all token holders experience proportional changes in their holdings. This preserves individual ownership percentages despite fluctuations in the total supply.
* **Balance of Benefits and Risks:** While rebase tokens offer advantages like automated price stabilization and decentralization, they also pose risks such as potential price volatility, user confusion, smart contract vulnerabilities, and regulatory uncertainties. It's essential to understand both sides before investing or using these tokens.
