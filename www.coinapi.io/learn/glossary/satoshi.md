Definition
----------

A **Satoshi** is the smallest unit of the cryptocurrency **Bitcoin**, representing one hundred-millionth of a single Bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC). Named after [**Satoshi Nakamoto**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/satoshi-nakamoto), the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, the satoshi allows for smaller transactions. This makes using Bitcoin for everyday purchases more practical. Given Bitcoin's high market value, satoshis make transactions manageable and easy to understand for users.

History
-------

The term "Satoshi" was introduced on the **BitcoinTalk** forum by ribuck on November 15, 2010. Initially, it represented one-hundredth of a Bitcoin. It was later refined to denote one-hundred-millionth of a Bitcoin. The Bitcoin community adopted the term to standardize the smallest unit, accommodating Bitcoin's growing value and usage.

How It Works
------------

Satoshis are subdivisions of Bitcoin. They allow users to transact in fractions of a Bitcoin without using many decimal places. For example, if Bitcoin is valued at $25,000, a price of $4 can be expressed as 0.00016 BTC or 16,000 satoshis. This subdivision makes transactions more intuitive, similar to using cents in traditional currency. It enhances Bitcoin's usability for small purchases.

Practical Applications
----------------------

Satoshis are used to facilitate **microtransactions** and everyday purchases. Using a full Bitcoin can be impractical due to its high value. Cryptocurrency exchanges and digital wallets support satoshis, allowing users to buy, sell, trade, and spend them easily. Merchants that accept Bitcoin can handle satoshis seamlessly. This versatility is crucial for Bitcoin's adoption as a medium of exchange.

Value and Market Relations
--------------------------

The value of a satoshi changes with Bitcoin's market price. For example, if Bitcoin is priced at $21,970.70, one satoshi is worth approximately $0.000219757. As Bitcoin's value increases, satoshis become more useful for precise transactions. However, a satoshi's small value means significant Bitcoin price increases are needed for it to match traditional currency units like a cent.

Using Satoshi
-------------

To use satoshis, users purchase Bitcoin through cryptocurrency exchanges. Bitcoin can then be stored in digital or hardware wallets. Once acquired, satoshis can be used with Bitcoin for transactions if the merchant accepts Bitcoin payments. This flexibility allows users to engage in daily transactions without dealing with large Bitcoin denominations. Additionally, satoshis can be traded for other cryptocurrencies or held as an investment.

Comparison with Other Denominations
-----------------------------------

Different cryptocurrencies have their own smallest units. For example, **Ethereum** uses "wei" as its smallest unit, with 1 wei equaling 1 quintillionth of an ether. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum use these tiny units for small transactions. However, their naming and numerical representations differ. This can cause confusion for newcomers to the cryptocurrency space. Understanding these differences is essential for managing transactions across various [blockchain](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/blockchain) platforms.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Smallest Unit of Bitcoin**: A satoshi is the smallest denomination of Bitcoin, equal to 0.00000001 BTC. This allows for precise and manageable transactions, especially important given Bitcoin's high market value.
* **Facilitates Microtransactions**: Satoshis enable the execution of microtransactions and everyday purchases without handling large Bitcoin amounts, enhancing Bitcoinâ€™s practicality as a medium of exchange.
* **Value Fluctuates with Bitcoin**: The value of a satoshi is directly tied to Bitcoinâ€™s market price. As Bitcoin's price increases, the relative value and utility of satoshis become more significant for users.
* **Comparison with Other Cryptocurrencies**: Different cryptocurrencies have their own smallest units, such as Ethereumâ€™s wei. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for accurately managing and transacting across various blockchain platforms.
