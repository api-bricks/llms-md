### API Key

An API key is a unique code that identifies and authorizes a user or application to access an APIâ€™s data and services securely.

What is an API key?
-------------------

An **API key** is a unique alphanumeric string used by developers to authenticate and authorize access to an API. It serves as a secret token that identifies the calling application, project, or user. This allows for controlled interaction with the [API](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/api)'s functionalities. API keys are essential for managing and securing the usage of APIs, ensuring that only authorized entities can access and utilize the provided services.

API Key Usage
-------------

### Controlling Access and Monitoring Usage

API keys primarily regulate access to APIs. By assigning unique keys to different applications or projects, API providers can monitor API usage. They can **track usage patterns and manage consumption effectively**. This is especially important for commercial applications where usage can be billed based on resources consumed. Additionally, API keys help in optimizing resource utilization and bandwidth by allowing only legitimate traffic through.

### Troubleshooting and Project Identification

Developers use API keys to troubleshoot integrations by identifying abnormal data patterns. They match API traffic to specific sources, which aids in isolating and resolving issues within applications that rely on multiple APIs. Moreover, API keys serve as project identifiers, ensuring that only authorized projects can access certain APIs. This maintains organizational security and integrity.

### Limiting API Calls

API keys enable providers to limit the number of API calls, the scope of accessible services, and the specific functionalities available to each key. For example, an API key can restrict an application to read-only access or limit the number of requests per day. These constraints help prevent abuse, manage load, and ensure fair usage among different users or applications.

Security
--------

While **API keys** are fundamental for API security, they are not inherently secure on their own. API keys are typically accessible to clients and can be vulnerable to theft if not properly protected. Common risks include:

* **Exposure in Source Code:** Embedding API keys directly in source code can lead to accidental disclosure, especially if the code is publicly accessible.
* **Lack of Expiration:** API keys without expiration dates can be misused indefinitely if compromised.
* **Insufficient Protection:** Transmitting API keys over insecure channels can expose them to interception.

To enhance security, API keys should be used with other security measures such as HTTPS, proper key management practices, and regular key rotation. It's also recommended to avoid using API keys for user [**authentication**](authentication) and to implement additional authentication tokens when necessary.

Best Practices
--------------

* **Avoid Using API Keys for User Authentication:** API keys should identify applications or projects, not individual users. Use more robust authentication methods like OAuth for user-specific access.
* **Protect API Keys:** Do not embed API keys directly in source code or expose them in client-side applications. Utilize environment variables or secure storage solutions to manage keys.
* **Implement Key Rotation and Expiration:** Regularly update API keys and set expiration dates to minimize the impact of potential key compromises.
* **Restrict [API Key Permissions](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/api-key-permissions):** Limit the scope and access rights of each API key to only what is necessary for its intended purpose.
* **Monitor and Log API Usage:** Continuously track the usage of API keys to detect and respond to unusual or unauthorized activities promptly.

Differences Between API Key and API Token
-----------------------------------------

While both API keys and API tokens are used for authentication and authorization, they serve different purposes:

* **API Key:** Primarily identifies the calling application or project. It does not carry user-specific information and is used to manage and monitor API usage at the application level.
* **API Token:** Contains comprehensive data that identifies a specific user and the scope of their access. API tokens are used for authenticating individual users and authorizing their specific actions within an API.

API tokens offer a higher level of security and granularity compared to API keys. They are suitable for scenarios requiring detailed user authentication and authorization.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **API Key Importance:** API keys are crucial for authentication and authorizing access to APIs. They ensure that only authorized applications or users can interact with the services. They help maintain secure and controlled access to API functionalities.
* **Secure Management:** Protecting API keys is essential. Avoid embedding them in source code, use environment variables or secure storage solutions, and implement regular key rotation and expiration to minimize unauthorized access risk.
* **Usage Monitoring:** Continuously monitor and log API key usage to track patterns, detect anomalies, and manage API consumption effectively. This helps in identifying potential abuse and optimizing resource utilization.
* **Access Control and Limitations:** Restrict the permissions and scope of each API key to only what is necessary for its intended purpose. Setting limits on API calls and access rights helps prevent misuse and ensures fair usage among different users or applications.
