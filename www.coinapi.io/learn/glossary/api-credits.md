### API Credits

API Credits are a data volume-based billing system used by cryptocurrency APIs and financial data providers to charge users based on the amount of data consumed rather than the number of API requests made.

Every day, developers make thousands of API calls to access cryptocurrency market data. Some requests return 50 data points, others return 5,000. Traditional APIs charge the same for both. API Credits changed this game by introducing fair, volume-based billing that revolutionized how developers pay for crypto data access.

While traditional APIs bill per request regardless of data returned, API Credits measure actual consumption, ensuring developers pay only for the cryptocurrency market data they receive.

What are API Credits?
---------------------

API Credits are a data volume-based billing system used by cryptocurrency APIs and financial data providers to charge users based on the amount of data consumed rather than the number of API requests made. This billing model ensures developers pay for actual cryptocurrency market data usage rather than request frequency.

Unlike traditional API pricing that charges per request, API Credits measure actual data consumption. Each credit typically represents a fixed number of data points (commonly 100 points). This approach eliminates the inefficiency where a single request returning 10 Bitcoin prices costs the same as one returning 10,000 trading records.

The credit system proves particularly valuable for cryptocurrency trading applications that require varying amounts of market data per request. Applications range from simple portfolio trackers to sophisticated algorithmic trading platforms.

How API Credits Work
--------------------

The API Credits system operates on a fundamental principle: **1 Credit = Up to 100 data points returned**. This cryptocurrency API billing model calculates charges based on actual data consumption rather than request frequency.

**Credit Calculation Process:**

* The system counts total data points in the API response
* Divides count by base unit (typically 100 points)
* Rounds up to the nearest whole number for final credit consumption
* Failed requests consume zero credits

**Request Processing Rules:**

* **Without limit parameter**: Each successful call = 1 credit (up to 100 data points)
* **With limit parameter**: Credits = ceiling(data\_points\_returned Ã· 100)
* **Exchange-wide requests**: Can consume 30+ credits for comprehensive cryptocurrency data
* **Metadata calls**: Simple exchange/symbol info typically = 1 credit each

This ensures developers building crypto trading bots pay fairly, whether requesting single Bitcoin prices or complete exchange order books.

Real-World Applications
-----------------------

API Credits prove essential across various cryptocurrency trading scenarios:

**Algorithmic Trading Bots**: High-frequency systems requesting thousands of price updates benefit from predictable credit-based costs rather than per-request charges.

**Portfolio Management**: Applications tracking multiple cryptocurrency holdings can optimize credit usage by batching requests efficiently.

**Market Analysis Platforms**: Research tools requiring large historical datasets can control costs by using limit parameters strategically.

**Mobile Trading Apps**: Simple price-checking applications consume minimal credits while maintaining full functionality.

Did You Know?
-------------

* A single exchange-wide OHLCV request can return 3,000+ data points, consuming 30+ credits in one call
* The largest CoinAPI request on record returned 50,000 cryptocurrency data points, consuming 500 credits
* Developers can reduce API Credits consumption by 90% using targeted symbol requests instead of exchange-wide queries
* Order book historical data uses special pricing, capped at 10 credits regardless of data volume
* The average cryptocurrency trading bot consumes 100-500 API Credits daily, depending on strategy complexity
* Smart limit parameters can reduce credit consumption while maintaining trading bot performance
* Some developers achieved 10x cost reduction by switching from traditional per-request pricing to API Credits

How CoinAPI Supports Efficient Credit Usage
-------------------------------------------

CoinAPI provides tools and features to help developers optimize their API Credits consumption:

**Smart Data Targeting**: Access specific cryptocurrency trading pairs rather than complete exchange feeds to minimize credit usage.

**Limit Parameters**: Control the exact data volume returned to manage credit consumption precisely.

**Flat Files Alternative**: Bulk historical data access with fixed GB pricing instead of credit-based billing for large datasets.

**Usage Monitoring**: Real-time credit consumption tracking through response headers and dashboard analytics.

**Optimization Guidance**: Documentation and examples showing cost-effective request patterns for different use cases.

With CoinAPI, developers can build sophisticated cryptocurrency trading applications while maintaining predictable, fair data costs.

API Credits in CoinAPI Cryptocurrency Data
------------------------------------------

**CoinAPI implements API Credits using a 100 point standard for cryptocurrency market data.** Each credit covers up to 100 data points returned in crypto API responses. This applies to Bitcoin price data, Ethereum trading history, cryptocurrency order book information, and crypto exchange metadata.

**CoinAPI API Credits Rules:**

* 1 API Credit = Up to 100 cryptocurrency data points
* Partial consumption rounds up (51 crypto data points = 1 credit)
* Failed cryptocurrency API requests don't consume credits
* Special pricing for crypto order book historical data (capped at 10 credits)

**Cryptocurrency API Examples with CoinAPI Credits:**

GET /v1/ohlcv/BINANCE\_SPOT\_BTC\_USDT/history?limit=24

Returns 24 Bitcoin price data points = 1 API Credit consumed

GET /v1/ohlcv/exchanges/COINBASE/history

Returns 3,000+ cryptocurrency data points = 30+ API Credits consumed

GET /v1/trades/BINANCE\_SPOT\_ETH\_USDT/history?limit=500

Returns 500 Ethereum trading records = 5 API Credits consumed

**API Credits Optimization for Cryptocurrency Data:**

* Use `limit` parameters to control crypto data volume and API Credits consumption
* Target specific cryptocurrency trading pairs rather than exchange-wide requests
* Consider Flat Files for bulk historical cryptocurrency data to minimize API Credits usage
* Monitor API Credits consumption using response headers for crypto trading applications

**API Credits provide transparent billing for cryptocurrency market data access.** This crypto API pricing model aligns costs with actual blockchain data consumption. The system benefits cryptocurrency developers and trading platforms by providing predictable API costs based on crypto market data usage patterns.

Things to Remember About API Credits
------------------------------------

**Volume-based fairness**: API Credits ensure you pay for actual cryptocurrency data consumption, not request frequency. This eliminates waste from traditional per-request billing models.

**Predictable costs**: The 100-point credit standard allows accurate cost estimation for cryptocurrency trading applications before development begins.

**Optimization opportunities**: Strategic use of limit parameters and targeted requests can dramatically reduce credit consumption while maintaining full functionality.

**CoinAPI advantage**: With over 370 cryptocurrency exchanges and comprehensive optimization tools, CoinAPI maximizes value per credit consumed.
