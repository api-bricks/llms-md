What is Market Data Feed?
=========================

A **Market Data Feed** is a continuous stream of [real-time data](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/real-time-data) transmitted to traders and investors. Market data feeds provide crucial insights such as price quotes, trade volumes, bid and ask prices, and historical data. This information enables market participants to make informed trading decisions swiftly and accurately.

Types of Market Data Feeds
--------------------------

### Level 1 (L1) Market Data

**Level 1 Data** provides a fundamental view of the market. It offers top-of-the-book information for specific financial instruments. This includes the best bid price (the highest price buyers are willing to pay), the best ask price (the lowest price sellers are demanding), and the last traded price.

L1 data is essential for traders seeking a quick snapshot of a security's current status. It facilitates immediate decision-making processes.

### Full-Depth Market Data

**Full-Depth Market Data** delivers a comprehensive view of the market's [order book](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/order-book), detailing every available price level and the number of orders at each point. This granular data allows traders to assess the depth of supply and demand.

It helps in identifying large players' positions and predicting potential price movements. While providing extensive insights, Full-Depth data can be overwhelming for beginners and typically comes at a higher cost.

### High-Speed Data Feeds

**High-Speed Data Feeds** are designed for high-frequency trading (HFT) environments where ultra-low [latency](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/latency) is critical. These feeds transmit data such as price quotes and trade executions with minimal delays.

Benefits of Market Data Feeds
-----------------------------

**Reliable market data feeds** are pivotal for accurate decision-making and [risk management](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/risk-management) in trading strategies. They enable traders to maximize profits by executing trades at optimal prices and times. Market data feeds reduce the likelihood of blind trading by providing comprehensive market insights. They offer a strategic edge through the identification of emerging trends and anomalies.
