### Expected Value

The expected value (EV) is a statistical measure that calculates the average outcome of a random variable over a large number of trials.

Expected Value - Definition
===========================

**Expected Value (EV)** is a fundamental statistical concept. It represents the average outcome of a random variable over numerous trials. **EV quantifies the long-term payoff or value** you can anticipate from a decision, event, or investment when outcomes are uncertain.

By calculating EV, individuals and businesses can assess risks and make informed decisions based on the probabilities of various outcomes.

Examples
--------

### Coin Toss

Consider a game where you **win $10** if a coin lands on heads and **lose $5** if it lands on tails. With equal probabilities of 0.5 for heads and tails:

`[ EV = (0.5 \times 10) + (0.5 \times (-5)) = 2.5 ]`

On average, you can expect to gain $2.50 per toss.

### Lottery Ticket

If a lottery ticket costs $2 with a 1% chance of winning $100:

`[ EV = (0.01 \times 100) + (0.99 \times (-2)) = -0.98 ]`

The expected loss is $0.98 per ticket.

Applications
------------

### Finance and Investing

EV is used to evaluate the risk and return of various investments, including stocks, options, and portfolios. It **aids investors** in selecting assets that align with their risk tolerance and return expectations.

### Gambling and Games

Gamblers and game designers utilize EV to determine the fairness and profitability of games of chance. This ensures that the games are balanced over the long term.

### Insurance

Insurers calculate premiums by assessing the expected value of claims. They balance potential payouts with the premiums collected.

### Business Decision-Making

Businesses use EV to evaluate potential revenues or costs under different scenarios. This guides strategic choices and investments.

### Cryptocurrency Trading

In cryptocurrency markets, EV helps traders assess the risk-reward ratio of trades by considering the probabilities of various price movements.

Advantages and Limitations
--------------------------

### Advantages

* **Quantitative Decision-Making**: Provides a numerical basis for evaluating options under uncertainty.
* **Comprehensive Risk Assessment**: Accounts for all possible outcomes and their probabilities.
* **Comparative Analysis**: Facilitates comparison between different investment or decision options.

### Limitations

* **Accurate Data Requirement**: This relies on precise probabilities and payoff estimates, which may not always be available.
* **Assumption of Rationality**: Assumes decisions are made rationally. This may neglect emotional or behavioral factors.

Properties
----------

* **Linearity**: The expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of their expected values.
* **Monotonicity**: If one random variable is always greater than another, its expected value is also greater.
* **Non-degeneracy**: If the expected value of the absolute value of a random variable is zero, the variable itself is zero almost.
* **Law of the Unconscious Statistician**: Allows calculation of EV for functions of random variables without knowing their distribution explicitly.

Uses and Applications
---------------------

### Investment Analysis

Investors use EV to estimate the potential return on investments. This helps them select the most promising projects based on expected profitability.

### Risk Management

EV assists in comparing different trading strategies. This ensures that long-term gains outweigh possible losses, effectively managing financial risks.

### Portfolio Optimization

Modern portfolio theory incorporates EV to balance expected returns against risk (standard deviation). This optimizes the allocation of assets in a portfolio.

### Quantum Mechanics

In quantum mechanics, EV represents the expectation value of an operator. This provides insights into measurable quantities like position and momentum in a quantum state.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Expected Value Definition**: EV is the probability-weighted average of all possible outcomes of a random variable, providing a central measure of the distribution's tendency.
* **Calculation Method**: For discrete variables, EV is calculated by summing each outcome multiplied by its probability. For continuous variables, an integral is used with the probability density function.
* **Key Applications**: EV is crucial in fields like finance, investing, gambling, insurance, and business decision-making. It enables risk assessment and informed strategic choices.
* **Advantages and Limitations**: While EV provides a quantitative basis for decisions and comprehensive risk assessment, it requires accurate data and assumes rational decision-making, which may not always hold.
