Principal Market Price - Definition
===================================

The **Principal Market Price** (PRIMKT) represents the price of a digital [**asset**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/assets) in U.S. dollars. It is derived from the asset's primary trading venue. This venue is the exchange with the highest trading volume for that [**trading pair**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/trading-pair). This method ensures that the price reflects the most [**liquidity**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/liquidity) and active market. As a result, it provides a reliable indicator for price discovery.

### Calculation Methodology

The PRIMKT Index is calculated through a systematic process:

* **Exchange Selection:** Only data from major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken are considered.
* **Symbol Selection:** Only SPOT trading pairs are included. This ensures accurate price representation.
* **Periods:** The calculation utilizes two periods:
  + **Activity Period:** Lasts 15 minutes before the calculation.
  + **Lookup Period:** Spans the last 60 minutes leading up to the calculation.
* **Exchange Filtering:** Exchanges without any trades in the Activity Period are excluded.
* **Data Collection:** For each eligible symbol, trading volume and last price data are gathered from the remaining exchanges during the Lookup Period.
* **Principal Market Determination:** The exchange with the highest trading volume for each symbol is identified as the principal market.
* **Index Value Calculation:** The index value is set to the last traded price on the principal market within the Lookup Period.

### Use Cases

* **Fair Value Measurement:** Assists in accurately determining the fair value of digital assets for financial reporting.
* **Financial Statement Preparation:** Provides reliable price data necessary for compiling financial statements.
* **Index Calculation:** Serves as a foundational element for creating financial benchmarks and indexes.
