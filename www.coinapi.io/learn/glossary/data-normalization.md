Data Normalization - Definition
===============================

**Data normalization** is the process of transforming data into a standardized format. This ensures **consistency**, **accuracy**, and **reliability** across various data sources. It is essential for integrating data from multiple origins, especially with diverse formats and standards.

**Data normalization** plays a crucial role in maintaining data quality and integrity. Organizations can eliminate discrepancies and errors from different data sources by standardizing data formats. This makes analyzing and comparing information more reliable. As a result, decisions based on the data are accurate and trustworthy.

Key Objectives
--------------

1. **Consistency:** Ensuring all data follows a uniform structure for easier analysis and comparison.
2. **Accuracy:** Removing discrepancies and errors from various data sources to provide reliable information.
3. **Interoperability:** Enabling seamless integration with different applications, tools, and platforms.
4. **Scalability:** Preparing data to support growth and adding new data sources without compromising quality.

Data Standardization vs Data Normalization
------------------------------------------

### [Data Standardization](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/data-standardization)

* Transforms data into consistent formats and structures
* The main goal is to make sure data from different sources looks and behaves the same
* Think of it like setting rules for how data should look:
  + Making all dates follow the same format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD)
  + Converting all currencies to one type (e.g., everything in USD)
  + Using consistent names for fields across systems
  + Setting uniform formats for numbers and text

### Data Normalization

* Organizes data to eliminate redundancy and improve database integrity
* The main goal is optimizing how data is stored and related to each other
* Think of it like organizing a filing system:
  + Removing duplicate information
  + Creating logical connections between different pieces of data
  + Breaking down large tables into smaller, related ones
  + Make sure each piece of data is stored only once

### Key Differences

1. **Purpose:** Standardization makes data uniform in appearance, while normalization makes it efficient in storage
2. **Focus:** Standardization deals with formats and units, while normalization deals with structure and relationships
3. **Techniques:** Standardization uses formatting rules and conversions, while normalization uses table creation and relationship mapping
4. **Outcome:** Standardization produces uniform data presentation, while normalization produces efficient data organization

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Consistency is Key:** Data normalization ensures that all datasets follow a uniform structure. This makes it easier to analyze and compare information across different sources. Uniformity is crucial for accurate data interpretation and decision-making.
* **Enhances Data Quality:** By eliminating discrepancies and errors, normalization significantly improves the **reliability** and **accuracy** of data. High-quality data is essential for effective analysis, reporting, and strategic planning.
* **Supports Scalability and Interoperability:** Normalized data can seamlessly integrate with various applications, tools, and platforms. This facilitates scalability as data volumes grow. Organizations can add new data sources without compromising the integrity of existing data.
* **Facilitates Real-Time Processing:** Effective normalization processes enable handling data in real time. This ensures that information remains up-to-date and relevant. This capability is particularly important in environments like cryptocurrency markets, where timely data is critical.
