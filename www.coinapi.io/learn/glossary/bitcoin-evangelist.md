Bitcoin Evangelist
==================

They encourage individuals, businesses, and governments to accept and integrate Bitcoin into their operations. They promote its use as a legitimate form of payment and investment.

### Critics of Traditional Systems

**Evangelists** highlight the limitations of traditional banking systems, such as inefficiency, censorship, and inflation risks. They present Bitcoin as a viable solution.
