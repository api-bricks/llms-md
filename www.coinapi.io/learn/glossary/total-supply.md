### Total Supply

Total Supply in cryptocurrency refers to the maximum number of tokens or coins that currently exist for a particular cryptocurrency. It represents all the coins that have been mined/created and are either in circulation or locked up in some way.

Total Supply - Definition
=========================

Total supply in [cryptocurrency](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/cryptocurrency) refers to the total number of coins or [tokens](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/token) that have been created and are currently in existence for a specific cryptocurrency. This metric includes all coins that have been mined or issued, whether they are in circulation, locked, reserved, or burned.

Understanding the total supply is crucial for evaluating a cryptocurrency's scarcity, value potential, and overall market dynamics. For example, Bitcoin has a total supply capped at 21 million BTC, whereas Ethereum has a total supply without a fixed maximum limit.

Total Supply vs. Circulating Supply
-----------------------------------

While total supply represents all existing coins minus burned tokens, [circulating supply](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/circulating-supply) specifically refers to the number of coins available for trading in the open market. Circulating supply excludes coins that are locked, reserved, or not yet released to the public.

For instance, Bitcoin's circulating supply is approximately 19 million BTC, which is about 90% of its total supply of 21 million BTC. This distinction is crucial as circulating supply directly influences [market capitalization](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/market-cap) and [liquidity](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/liquidity).

Total Supply vs. Max Supply
---------------------------

**Max supply** is the absolute limit on the number of coins that will ever exist for a cryptocurrency, as defined by its protocol. In contrast, total supply includes all coins that have been created up to the current point, which can approach but not exceed the max supply if one exists.

Impact on Scarcity and Value
----------------------------

The total supply of a cryptocurrency plays a significant role in determining its scarcity and potential value appreciation. A lower total supply can indicate higher scarcity, potentially driving up the cryptocurrency's value if demand remains strong.

A large total supply might dilute the value of each coin, making significant price increases more challenging. For instance, Binance Coin regularly undergoes token burns to reduce its total supply, thereby increasing scarcity and potentially enhancing its value over time.

Coin Burns and Total Supply
---------------------------

[Coin burning](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/crypto-burning) is a process where a certain number of cryptocurrency tokens are permanently removed from circulation, effectively reducing the total supply. This mechanism is often employed to control inflation, increase scarcity, and boost the value of the remaining tokens.

For example, Binance conducts quarterly burns of BNB tokens, decreasing the total supply and supporting the coin's value. This transparent and verifiable process is recorded on the [blockchain](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/blockchain), ensuring trust and integrity within the ecosystem.

Significance in Investment Decisions
------------------------------------

Understanding a cryptocurrency's total supply is essential for making informed investment decisions. Investors analyze the ratio between circulating supply and total supply to assess potential price movements and market dynamics. A high percentage of circulating supply relative to total supply can indicate limited future dilution, potentially leading to price appreciation.

A low circulating supply relative to total supply may suggest the risk of future inflation and downward pressure on prices. Evaluating total supply alongside other metrics like market capitalization and tokenomics provides a comprehensive view of a cryptocurrency's investment potential.

Total Supply in Tokenomics
--------------------------

In the framework of [**tokenomics**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/tokenomics), total supply is a fundamental metric that influences a cryptocurrency's economic model and market behavior. It affects aspects such as distribution strategies, emission rates, and the overall sustainability of the project.

Total supply metrics help developers and project teams plan token distribution, governance, and future development initiatives. Additionally, it aids in maintaining transparency and trust among users and investors by providing a clear picture of the token's availability and potential scarcity.

Total Supply and Market Capitalization
--------------------------------------

Market capitalization of a cryptocurrency is calculated by multiplying the total supply by the current price of the token. This metric provides a snapshot of the cryptocurrency's market size and overall valuation. However, it's important to note that market capitalization based on total supply may not always reflect the true market potential, as it includes locked or reserved tokens that are not actively trading. For a more accurate representation, analysts often consider circulating supply alongside total supply when assessing a cryptocurrency's market capitalization.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Total Supply Definition**: Total Supply encompasses all coins or tokens that have been created, including those in circulation, locked, reserved, or burned. It provides a comprehensive view of a cryptocurrency's availability and potential scarcity.
* **Difference between Circulating and Max Supply**: While Total Supply includes all existing tokens minus burned ones, Circulating Supply refers to those available for trading, and Max Supply is the absolute limit of tokens that will ever exist. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for accurate market assessment.
* **Impact on Value and Scarcity**: A lower Total Supply can indicate higher scarcity, potentially increasing a cryptocurrency's value if demand is strong. Conversely, a higher Total Supply might dilute individual token value, affecting price appreciation.
* **Role in Investment and Tokenomics**: Total Supply is essential for investment decisions, influencing market capitalization and investment potential. Tokenomics affects distribution strategies, emission rates, and the overall economic model of the cryptocurrency project.
