Peer-To-Peer Trading - Definition
---------------------------------

Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading allows the direct exchange of [assets](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/assets) like cryptocurrencies. **This approach does not involve a centralized authority or intermediary.** Instead, individuals trade directly using their preferred payment methods. P2P trading offers greater privacy and flexibility than traditional trading platforms. It leverages [blockchain](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/blockchain) technology and smart contracts. These ensure secure and transparent [transactions](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/transaction). Assets are exchanged only when both parties fulfill the agreed terms.

### **How it Works**

Sellers list their assets and buyers choose from various offers. When both agree, the platform uses an escrow service. **Escrow** holds the cryptocurrency until the transaction is confirmed by both. This reduces fraud risk by releasing assets only when payment and cryptocurrency have been exchanged successfully.

### **Advantages**

* **Flexibility of Payment Methods**: Traders can use various payment options, including bank transfers, digital wallets, or cash. This allows for more convenient transactions.
* **Lower or No Trading Fees**: P2P platforms connect buyers and sellers directly. They often charge minimal fees, saving users costs compared to Centralized Exchange
* **Enhanced Privacy**: P2P trading requires less personal information. This helps users maintain privacy and reduces the risk of data breaches.
* **Global Marketplace Access**: P2P platforms allow users worldwide to trade seamlessly. This expands the pool of trading partners and improves [Liquidity](#Liquidity).
* **Customized Trade Offers**: Sellers can create tailored listings with specific terms. These may include discounts or preferred payment methods, attracting diverse buyers.

### **Disadvantages**

* **Risk of Scams**: Without a centralized authority, there is a higher risk of encountering fraudulent actors. Users must verify their trading partners' credibility.
* **Slower Transaction Times**: P2P trades rely on manual processes, which can cause delays. This is especially true if one party is unresponsive or if there are transaction discrepancies. Market volatility can also impact agreed prices during these delays.
* **Liquidity Issues**: In certain markets or for specific cryptocurrencies, finding a matching buyer or seller at the desired price can be challenging. This leads to extended waiting periods and potential price fluctuations.

### **Security Measures**

To mitigate P2P trading risks, platforms implement various security features. These include encryption, Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), and escrow services. These measures ensure **transactions are secure and assets are protected until trade terms are fulfilled.** User ratings and feedback systems help establish trust between parties.

Things to Remember

* **Disadvantages**: Presents risks such as potential scams, slower transaction times due to manual processes, and liquidity issues in certain markets or for specific cryptocurrencies.
