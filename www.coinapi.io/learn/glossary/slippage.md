### Slippage

Slippage is the difference between the expected price of a cryptocurrency trade and the actual executed price. It occurs when market conditions change between the time you place an order and when it's completed - often happening during periods of high volatility or with large orders in markets that have limited liquidity.

Slippage - What is it?
======================

Slippage refers to the difference between the **expected price** of a cryptocurrency order and the price at which the order is executed. This occurs due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets, where prices can change rapidly based on trade volume and market activity.

For example, if you place an order to buy Bitcoin at $30,000, but the order executes at $30,050, you experience a slippage of $50. Understanding slippage is crucial for traders as it can significantly impact the profitability and outcome of trades.

Causes of Slippage
------------------

Slippage is primarily caused by the [liquidity](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/liquidity) of the market. Liquidity measures how quickly an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its price. In markets with low liquidity or low [trading](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/trades) activity, orders are more likely to experience higher slippage percentages.

For instance, selling a large quantity of a less popular cryptocurrency in a market with few buyers can result in parts of the order being filled at lower prices, leading to increased slippage.

Types of Slippage
-----------------

There are two main types of slippage that traders encounter:

1. **Price Slippage**: This occurs when the executed price deviates from the expected price due to market volatility. For example, attempting to buy a coin at $100 but executing the trade at $102 results in a $2 price slippage.
2. **Liquidity Slippage**: This happens when there aren't enough buyers or sellers at the desired price level, causing your order to be filled at different prices. Selling a large amount of a niche cryptocurrency in a small market might lead to parts of your order being executed at lower prices.

Understanding these types helps traders anticipate and manage the potential impact on their trades.

Key Factors Affecting Slippage
------------------------------

Several key factors influence the occurrence and extent of slippage in cryptocurrency trading:

* **Market Volatility**: High [volatility](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/volatility) can cause significant price changes between order placement and execution.
* **Order Size**: Large orders may not be filled at a single price point, especially in markets with limited volume.
* **Market Liquidity**: Low liquidity markets have fewer buyers and sellers, increasing the likelihood of price changes impacting order execution.

By accounting for these factors, traders can develop strategies to minimize unwanted slippage and manage their trading outcomes more effectively.

Minimizing Slippage
-------------------

Traders can employ several strategies to reduce the impact of slippage on their cryptocurrency transactions:

* **Using limit orders**: Unlike [market orders](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/market-order), [limit orders](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/limit-order) allow you to set a specific price for buying or selling, ensuring that the order is only executed at the desired price or better.
* **Avoiding market orders in volatile markets**: Market orders execute immediately at the best available price, which can lead to significant slippage in volatile conditions.
* **Trading during peak hours**: Higher market activity during peak hours increases liquidity, reducing the likelihood of slippage.
* **Avoiding major news events**: Significant news can cause sudden price movements, so timing trades to avoid these periods can help minimize slippage.

Implementing these strategies can lead to more efficient and controlled transactions, even though it may not eliminate slippage.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Definition of Slippage**: Slippage is the difference between the expected price of a cryptocurrency order and the price at which it is executed. This phenomenon is common in volatile markets and can affect trade profitability.
* **Causes of Slippage**: The primary causes include market liquidity and volatility. Low liquidity means fewer buyers and sellers are available, increasing the chances of price fluctuations during order execution.
* **Types of Slippage**: There are two main typesâ€”price slippage, which occurs due to market price changes, and liquidity slippage, which happens when there aren't enough participants at the desired price level to fill an order.
* **Strategies to Minimize Slippage**: Traders can reduce slippage by using limit orders, avoiding market orders in volatile conditions, trading during peak market hours, and steering clear of major news events that may cause sudden price movements.
