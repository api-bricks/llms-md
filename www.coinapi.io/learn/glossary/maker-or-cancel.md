### Maker-or-Cancel

Maker-or-Cancel is a type of trading order that will only execute if it adds liquidity to the order book (becomes a maker order). If the order would immediately match with an existing order (taking liquidity), it is automatically cancelled.

Maker or Cancel (MOC) Order
---------------------------

A maker or cancel (MOC) order is a specialized [order type](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/order-type) in financial markets. It is designed to enhance [liquidity](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/liquidity) by ensuring that orders are added to the [order book](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/order-book) as [maker orders](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/market-order). Unlike traditional orders that might immediately match with existing orders, known as taker orders, MOC orders will only execute if they can be placed on the order book without matching an existing order. If an MOC order would result in an immediate match, it is automatically canceled. This mechanism distinguishes traders who contribute liquidity from those who take liquidity, fostering a more balanced and efficient market environment.

When to use MOC Orders
----------------------

MOC orders are beneficial for traders aiming to minimize transaction costs and act as liquidity providers. For example, traders implementing [market-making](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/market-maker) strategies on cryptocurrency exchanges often use MOC orders to ensure their trades add liquidity to the market. By doing so, these traders can avoid higher taker fees associated with orders that consume liquidity and may even earn rebates for their role in providing liquidity. This strategic use of MOC orders can lead to more cost-effective trading and potentially higher profitability over time.

Benefits of Using MOC Orders
----------------------------

The primary benefits of using maker-or-cancel orders include reduced trading fees and the opportunity to earn rebates. By ensuring that orders contribute to liquidity, traders can avoid the higher fees typically charged for taker orders that remove liquidity from the market. Additionally, many exchanges offer incentives for liquidity providers, allowing traders who consistently use MOC orders to benefit financially beyond just reduced fees. This makes MOC orders an attractive option for active traders and institutions focused on long-term market strategies.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Enhanced Liquidity**: Maker or Cancel orders ensure that only non-matching orders are added to the order book, contributing to overall market liquidity and fostering a balanced trading environment.
* **All-or-Nothing Execution**: MOC orders are either fully placed without immediate matches or entirely canceled, preventing partial fills and ensuring that only complete contributions are made to the order book.
* **Cost Efficiency**: Utilizing MOC orders can reduce trading fees by avoiding taker fees and may provide opportunities to earn rebates, making them advantageous for cost-conscious traders.
* **Strategic Application**: MOC orders are integral to advanced trading strategies, such as market-making and high-frequency trading, by maintaining order book depth and enhancing market stability.
