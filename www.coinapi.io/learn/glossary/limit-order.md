What is a Limit Order?
======================

A limit order is a type of trade instruction used by investors. It allows buying or selling a security at a specified price or better. Unlike [**market orders**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/market-order), which execute immediately at the current market price, limit orders offer greater control over the execution price. However, they do not guarantee that the order will be filled. This makes limit orders a strategic tool in volatile or fast-moving markets.

A limit order directs a broker to buy or sell a security at a designated price or more favorable. For a buy limit order, this means purchasing the security at the limit price or lower, acting as a price ceiling.

Conversely, a sell limit order entails selling the security at the limit price or higher, setting a price floor. This ensures that the trader does not pay more than the desired price when buying or receives less than the desired price when selling.

When to Use Limit Orders
------------------------

Limit orders are particularly useful when price control is important. Traders often use limit orders during pre-market or after-hours trading sessions. During these times, [**liquidity**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/liquidity) is lower and price [**volatility**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/volatility) is higher.

By setting specific price thresholds, traders can ensure that their orders are only executed when the market moves to their desired price levels. Additionally, limit orders are beneficial when trading thinly traded securities. They help in entering or exiting positions without significantly affecting the market price.

Advantages of Limit Orders
--------------------------

Limit orders offer several advantages for traders seeking precision and control in their trades:

* **Price Control**: Traders can set specific price ceilings for purchases or price floors for sales. This protects them from unfavorable price movements.
* **Extended Trading Sessions**: Limit orders can be placed during pre-market and after-hours sessions. This allows participation outside standard trading times.
* **Strategic Execution**: By specifying conditions such as "all or none" or **[fill or kill](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/fill-or-kill-fok),** traders can refine how their orders are executed. This reduces the risk of partial fills.
* **Flexibility in Order Duration**: Various limit order types, such as [**good till cancelled**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/good-till-cancelled), and extended, provide flexibility. They match different trading strategies and timeframes.

These features make limit orders a versatile tool. They help manage trades in various market conditions, ensuring trades align with the trader's objectives.

Risks of Limit Orders
---------------------

While limit orders provide greater control over trade execution prices, they come with certain risks:

* **No Execution Guarantee**: If the market price does not reach the specified limit price, the order may not be executed.
* **Partial Fills**: Orders may be partially filled if there aren't enough shares available at the limit price. This leaves some shares untraded.
* **Missed Opportunities**: In fast-moving markets, waiting for a specific price may result in missed trading opportunities if the price never reaches the limit order level.
* **Potential for Higher Costs**: Placing multiple limit orders without a proper strategy can lead to higher transaction costs. This may be due to partial fills or multiple order executions.

Traders must weigh these risks against the benefits of price control. This helps determine whether limit orders align with their trading strategies.

Types of Limit Orders
---------------------

Limit orders can be customized based on their duration and the trading sessions in which they are active:

* **Day Limit Orders**: Valid only during the standard trading session. They expire at the end of the day if not filled.
* **[Good Till Cancelled](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/good-till-cancelled) (GTC) Limit Orders**: Remain active across multiple trading days. They stay until the order is executed or canceled, typically lasting up to 180 days at brokers like Schwab.
* **Extended Limit Orders**: Active during pre-market and after-hours sessions. This allows execution in extended trading times.
* **[Immediate Or Cancel](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/immediate-or-cancel) (IOC) Limit Orders**: Require that any part of the order that can be filled immediately is executed. The remaining portion is canceled.

These variations provide flexibility. Traders can tailor their orders to specific timeframes and market conditions.

Practical Applications
----------------------

Limit orders are essential for implementing strategic trading approaches, such as:

* **Protecting Profit Margins**: Setting a sell limit order can lock in profits. This is done by selling a security once it reaches a target price.
* **Cost Management**: Buy limit orders ensure that purchases are made only at acceptable price levels. This prevents overpayment in volatile markets.
* **Risk Mitigation**: Combining limit orders with **[stop orders](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/stop-order)** can manage downside risks. Traders can set predefined exit points.
* **Portfolio Rebalancing**: Limit orders can facilitate the buying or selling of securities. This helps maintain a desired **[portfolio management](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/portfolio-management)** without reacting to short-term market fluctuations.

These applications highlight the practical benefits of using limit orders to achieve specific trading goals. They help manage investment risks effectively.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Precise Price Control**: Limit orders allow traders to specify the exact price at which they are willing to buy or sell. This ensures transactions occur only at desired levels. This precision helps in avoiding unfavorable price movements.
* **No Guarantee of Execution**: Unlike **market orders**, limit orders do not guarantee execution. If the market does not reach the specified limit price, the order may remain unfilled. This can potentially miss trading opportunities.
* **Flexibility in Order Duration**: Various types of limit orders, such as Day, **good till cancelled**, and Extended, offer flexibility. This caters to different trading strategies and timeframes.
* **Risk of Partial Fills**: There is a possibility that only a portion of the limit order is filled. This happens if there aren't enough available shares at the limit price. Traders should consider this when planning their trades to manage positions effectively.
