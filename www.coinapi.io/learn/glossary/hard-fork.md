### Hard Fork

A hard fork is a radical change to a blockchain's protocol that makes previously invalid blocks and transactions valid (or vice versa), requiring all network participants to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software.

Hard Fork Meaning
-----------------

A hard fork is a significant change to a [**blockchain**'s](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/blockchain) protocol. It makes previously valid blocks and transactions invalid. This update is not backward compatible. [Nodes](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/node) running the old software will not accept new blocks from nodes with the updated software. As a result, a hard fork splits the blockchain into two separate chains. One follows the original rules, and the other follows the new protocols. Users and developers must choose which chain to support. This often leads to the creation of a new **cryptocurrency** alongside the original one.

Reasons for Implementing Hard Forks
-----------------------------------

Hard forks are typically initiated for several key reasons:

* **Major upgrades**. Introducing significant improvements or new features requires changes to the core protocol.
* **Security enhancements**. Addressing vulnerabilities or bugs improves the blockchain's security.
* **Community disagreements**. Resolving conflicts within the community about the blockchain's future may lead to alternative cryptocurrencies.
* **Reversing transactions**. Corrective actions in response to events like hacks or fraud, such as the Ethereum DAO heist.

These forks can be driven by developers or factions within the community. They seek to guide the blockchain in a different direction.

Notable Examples of Hard Forks
------------------------------

Several high-profile hard forks have shaped the cryptocurrency landscape:

* **Bitcoin Cash (BCH)**. In August 2017, Bitcoin underwent a hard fork to create Bitcoin Cash. It increased the block size from 1MB to 8MB to improve transaction speed and scalability.
* **Ethereum and Ethereum Classic (ETC)**. Following the DAO hack in 2016, Ethereum implemented a hard fork. The fork reversed the malicious transactions and returned funds to investors. This decision led to a split. Ethereum Classic continued on the original blockchain without the reversal.

These examples show how hard forks can lead to new cryptocurrencies while preserving the original blockchain.

Impact and Considerations
-------------------------

Hard forks can significantly impact the blockchain ecosystem:

* **Network security**. Splitting the blockchain can reduce the networkâ€™s security if the new chain has fewer participants.
* **Market valuation**. Creating a new cryptocurrency can affect the market value of both the original and new tokens. This often causes volatility.
* **Replay attacks**. After a hard fork, malicious actors might exploit the system by duplicating transactions across both chains. Measures can prevent this.
* **Community division**. Hard forks can create factions within the community. This leads to debates and disagreements about the best path forward.

Overall, while hard forks can drive necessary improvements, they also bring challenges. These require careful management to maintain the integrity and stability of the blockchain network.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Non-Backward-Compatible Changes**. Hard forks involve significant protocol updates that are not compatible with previous versions. This leads to a split in the blockchain.
* **Upgrade Requirement**. All participants must upgrade their software to remain on the new chain. Those who don't will continue on the original blockchain.
* **Reasons for Hard Forks**. They are initiated for major upgrades, security enhancements, resolving community disagreements, or reversing transactions after incidents.
* **Impact on Ecosystem**. Hard forks can affect network security, market valuation, lead to replay attacks, and create community divisions.
