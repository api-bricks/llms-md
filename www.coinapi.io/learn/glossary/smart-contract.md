### Smart Contract

A smart contract is a self-executing digital agreement written in code and stored on a blockchain. It automatically enforces and executes the terms of a contract when predetermined conditions are met, without needing intermediaries.

Definition
----------

A smart contract is a decentralized computer program that operates on a [blockchain](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/blockchain) network. It **automatically executes agreements** when predefined conditions are met. Originating with the Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts are foundational for the Web3 ecosystem. They enable applications in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gaming, and more.

Functionality
-------------

Smart contracts work on an "if/when x event happens, then execute y action" logic. They contain code that **specifies conditions and outcomes**. Hosted on a decentralized blockchain, smart contracts ensure agreements are executed accurately and tamper-proof. This process does not require a central authority.

Blockchain Integration
----------------------

Smart contracts are supported by blockchains like Ethereum and Avalanche. These blockchains support running application logic alongside their native consensus mechanisms. This structure allows developers to create decentralized applications (dApps). The smart contract code governs the applicationâ€™s behavior, executed and stored by the blockchain network.

History
-------

Nick Szabo introduced the concept of smart contracts in 1994. He envisioned them as **computerized transaction protocols** that execute contract terms. Blockchain technology, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum, made smart contracts practical. Ethereumâ€™s launch in 2015 allowed the deployment of multiple smart contracts simultaneously.

Applications
------------

### Financial Products (DeFi)

Smart contracts are essential for DeFi platforms. They automate services like **lending, borrowing, and asset management without intermediaries**. For example, Aave uses smart contracts for permissionless lending. Compound enables governance through token-based voting.

### Gaming and NFTs

In gaming and NFTs, smart contracts ensure fair execution of actions and secure token ownership. PoolTogether uses smart contracts to manage no-loss savings games. Chainlinkâ€™s Verifiable Random Function (VRF) provides tamper-proof randomness for NFT distribution and game mechanics.

### Insurance

Smart contracts facilitate parametric insurance by automating payouts based on specific events. For example, crop insurance smart contracts trigger payouts automatically if certain weather conditions, like rainfall levels, meet the contract terms.

Benefits
--------

* **Security**: Decentralized execution on blockchain networks removes single points of failure.
* **Reliability**: Multiple nodes process contracts, ensuring correct and timely execution.
* **Equitability**: Eliminates centralized intermediaries, ensuring fair participation.
* **Efficiency**: Automates processes like escrow and settlement, increasing speed and reducing costs.

Limitations
-----------

* **Immutability**: Smart contracts cannot be altered once deployed, making them vulnerable to bugs.
* **Smart Contract Risk**: Code vulnerabilities can lead to undesirable outcomes, requiring thorough audits.
* **Offchain Dependencies**: Smart contracts need oracles, like Chainlink, to access external data.

Examples
--------

Smart contracts automate agreements and processes in various sectors. In global trade, contracts can execute payments based on shipment arrival times. In DeFi, platforms like Aave manage lending and borrowing without intermediaries. Gaming platforms use smart contracts to ensure fair play and secure asset distribution. Insurance applications automate payouts based on predefined events like weather conditions.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Definition**: Smart contracts are decentralized programs on blockchain networks that automatically execute agreements when conditions are met.
* **Operational Logic**: They use "if/when x event happens, then execute y action" to ensure accurate and tamper-proof execution without central authorities.
* **Key Benefits**: Smart contracts provide enhanced security, reliability, equitability, and efficiency by eliminating intermediaries and automating processes.
* **Diverse Applications**: They are used in DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and insurance to facilitate automated and fair execution across different industries.
