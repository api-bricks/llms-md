Negative Rho - Definition
=========================

**Negative Rho** is a measure in options trading that shows how an option's price decreases when interest rates increase. It is one of the "Greeks," which assess an option's sensitivity to various factors. Specifically, **Negative Rho** indicates the expected change in an optionâ€™s price with a 1% change in interest rates.

When Does Negative Rho Occur?
-----------------------------

**Negative Rho** usually appears in put options. This means their value tends to drop as interest rates rise. However, certain call options can also show Negative Rho in specific situations:

### Deep In-the-Money Calls

For deep in-the-money call options, the value may decrease if interest rates rise. This happens when carrying costs, like dividends or borrowing costs, outweigh the benefits of holding the option.

### Short-Dated Options

Short-term options can experience unexpected price changes due to interest rate fluctuations. This can lead to Negative Rho even for call options.

### Exotic Options

Some complex derivatives or structured products have Rho values that differ from standard options. Under certain conditions, these can result in Negative Rho for call options.

Practical Implications
----------------------

Understanding **Negative Rho** is essential for traders and institutional investors. In environments where interest rates are expected to rise, options with Negative Rho may lose value unexpectedly.

This knowledge is crucial for developing effective hedging strategies and managing risk, especially in varying interest rate scenarios.

Calculation and Usage
---------------------

Rho measures an option's sensitivity to changes in the risk-free interest rate, typically expressed in dollar terms. It shows how much an option's price is expected to change with a 1% change in interest rates.

While Rho is often seen as the least important Greek, it becomes significant during large or unexpected interest rate movements or with options that have longer timeframes until expiration.

Examples
--------

* **Positive Rho Example:** A long call option might increase in value as interest rates rise because the cost of carrying the option decreases, benefiting the holder.
* **Negative Rho Example:** A long put option may decrease in value as interest rates rise since maintaining the short position becomes more expensive.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Negative Rho Definition:** Negative Rho measures how an option's price decreases with a 1% rise in interest rates. It is a crucial Greek for assessing an option's sensitivity to interest rate changes.
* **Primarily Affects Put Options:** While Negative Rho is most commonly associated with put options, some call options can also exhibit Negative Rho under specific conditions, such as being deep in-the-money or short-dated.
* **Impact on Trading Strategies:** Understanding Negative Rho is essential for traders, especially when interest rates are expected to rise. Options with Negative Rho may lose value, affecting hedging strategies and overall risk management.
* **Rho's Relevance in Complex Scenarios:** Although often considered less significant than other Greeks, Rho becomes important in scenarios involving large or unexpected interest rate movements and with options that have longer expiration periods.
