### Free Float Market Capitalization

Free Float Market Capitalization (also called public float market cap) is the market value of a company's shares that are freely available for trading in the public market. It's calculated by multiplying the current share price by the number of shares available for public trading.

Free Float Market Capitalization in Cryptocurrency
==================================================

Free Float Market Capitalization represents the market value of a cryptocurrency's publicly tradable tokens. It is calculated by multiplying the current price per token by the Adjusted Free Float Supply. This supply excludes tokens that are locked, reserved, or held for long-term purposes.

This metric accurately reflects market value by considering only the actively traded and publicly accessible tokens. It distinguishes itself from the total market capitalization, which includes all outstanding tokens regardless of their liquidity.

Importance in Crypto Markets
----------------------------

Free Float Market Capitalization is crucial for assessing a cryptocurrency's true liquidity and market dynamics. By focusing solely on the tokens available for public trading, it offers investors and traders a clearer picture of the asset's market behavior and investment potential.

This distinction is particularly important in cryptocurrency markets where project teams, foundations, or other strategic entities often hold a significant portion of the supply. These holders can influence the asset's volatility and trading volume.

Calculation Methodology
-----------------------

The free float market cap is calculated using the following formula:

`Free Float Market Capitalization = Token Price Ã— (Total Supply â€“ Locked Tokens)`

Practical Applications
----------------------

* **Investment Analysis**: Investors use free float market cap to evaluate a cryptocurrency's actual tradable value, helping in making informed investment decisions.
* **Liquidity Assessment**: It helps in assessing the liquidity of a cryptocurrency. Higher free float typically indicates lower volatility and easier trading.

Relation to Market Volatility
-----------------------------

Free Float Market Capitalization is inversely related to market volatility. A higher free float implies a larger number of tokens available for trading, generally leading to lower volatility as large trades do not significantly impact the token price. Conversely, a lower free float means fewer tokens are available, making the asset more susceptible to price manipulation and higher volatility.

Advantages Over Total Market Capitalization
-------------------------------------------

* **Accuracy**: Provides a more precise measure of a cryptocurrency's market value by excluding non-tradable tokens
* **Enhanced Liquidity Insight**: Reflects the true liquidity available in the market
* **Reduced Distortion**: Minimizes the impact of large holders on market cap, offering a clearer view of an asset's market position

Key Points to Remember
----------------------

1. **Definition**: Free Float Market Capitalization measures the market value of only the publicly tradable tokens, excluding those that are locked, reserved, or held privately.
2. **Importance for Crypto Investors**: It offers a more accurate assessment of a cryptocurrency's liquidity and tradable value, enabling investors to make informed decisions based on the actual available supply.
3. **Impact on Volatility**: A higher free float typically leads to lower market volatility, as more tokens are available for trading, reducing the impact of large trades on the asset's price.
4. **Market Analysis**: Free Float Market Cap offers enhanced accuracy and liquidity insights by excluding non-tradable tokens, providing a more realistic view of the cryptocurrency's market position.
