What is a Quote?
----------------

A **quote** refers to the most recent price at which an asset was traded between a buyer and a seller. It shows the last agreed-upon price and the quantity transacted. In financial markets, quotes are essential for determining the value of securities and facilitating trading decisions.

Quotes are divided into two components: the bid and the ask.

The bid is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for an asset.

The ask is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept.

The difference between the bid and ask prices is known as the **[bid-ask spread](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/bid-ask-spread)**. This spread reflects the [**liquidity**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/liquidity) and volatility of the asset.

Types of Quotes
---------------

Quotes can be categorized based on the level of detail they provide:

* [**Level 1 Quotes**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/level-1-data): Display the best bid and ask prices along with their respective sizes. This level is commonly used for basic trading and investment decisions.
* [**Level 2 Quotes**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/level-2-data): Show multiple bids and ask prices from different market participants. This provides a more comprehensive view of the market, allowing traders to assess the buying and selling pressure behind a security.
* [**Level 3 Quotes**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/level-3-data): Offer the most detailed view, including the full order book with all pending orders. This level is useful for high-frequency trading and in-depth market analysis.

Accessing Quotes Data
---------------------

Quotes data can be accessed through various platforms and APIs:

* **HTTP APIs**: Provide access to historical and real-time quote data. They are suitable for integration into trading platforms and analytical tools.
* **WebSocket APIs**: Offer real-time streaming of quotes. This enables immediate access to the latest market information for high-frequency trading applications.
* **Order Book Snapshots**: Deliver periodic snapshots of the order book. These snapshots capture the state of market quotes at specific intervals for historical analysis.

Historical and Real-Time Data
-----------------------------

Quotes data is available in both historical and real-time formats:

* **Historical Quotes**: Allow investors to analyze past market behavior, identify trends, and develop long-term investment strategies based on historical performance.
* **Real-Time Quotes**: Provide up-to-the-minute pricing information essential for active trading and immediate decision-making in volatile markets.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Understanding Quote Components**: Quotes consist of the bid and ask prices. The bid is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay. The ask is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept. The difference between them, known as the [Bid-Ask Spread](#bid-ask-spread), indicates the asset's [liquidity](#liquidity) and volatility.
* **Levels of Quotes**: There are three levels of quotes. Level 1 provides the best bid and ask prices. Level 2 adds depth with multiple bids and asks. Level 3 offers a complete [Order Book](#order-book). Each level provides varying degrees of market depth for different trading and analysis needs.
* **Practical Applications of Quotes**: Quotes are crucial for Real-Time Trading, Algo Trading, market analysis, and risk management. They enable traders and investors to make informed decisions, execute strategies, and manage potential risks effectively.
* **Accessing Quotes Data**: Quotes data can be accessed through various platforms and APIs, including HTTP APIs for historical and real-time data, WebSocket APIs for real-time streaming, and order book snapshots for specific intervals. These tools are essential for leveraging market information in trading and analysis.
