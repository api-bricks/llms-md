### Pay-Per-Last N Shares (PPLNS)

Pay-Per-Last N Shares (PPLNS) is a reward system used by cryptocurrency mining pools to distribute earnings among miners based on their recent contributions to the pool's overall work.

Pay-Per-Last N Shares (PPLNS) - Definition
==========================================

**Pay-Per-Last N Shares (PPLNS)** is a cryptocurrency mining pool reward distribution method. In a PPLNS system, miners are rewarded based on the number of shares they contribute within the last 'N' shares submitted to the pool before a block is successfully mined. This approach ties rewards to recent contributions. It promotes fairness and consistent participation among miners.

How PPLNS Works
---------------

In the PPLNS model, the mining pool maintains a "sliding window" of the last 'N' shares submitted by all miners. When a block is mined, miners distribute the total block reward proportionally based on their share contributions within this window.

For example, if the pool sets 'N' to 1,000,000 shares and a miner has contributed 10,000 shares within this period, the miner would receive 1% of the block reward. Shares outside the 'N' window do not contribute to payouts for that block.

Key Characteristics
-------------------

### Luck Factor

**PPLNS rewards** are distributed only when a block is mined. This can cause short-term earnings to fluctuate based on the pool's success in finding blocks. This introduces variability in payouts, with periods of no rewards followed by higher payouts when blocks are discovered.

### Efficiency Incentive

**PPLNS encourages** long-term commitment by rewarding miners who consistently contribute shares over time. This reduces the likelihood of "pool hopping," where miners switch pools to maximize short-term gains. It fosters a more stable mining environment.

### Lower Pool Fees

Compared to fixed-payment models like Pay-Per-Share (PPS), PPLNS pools often have lower fees. Since the pool does not take on the risk of paying miners without finding blocks, operational costs are reduced. This benefits miners with lower fees.

Advantages of PPLNS
-------------------

* **Consistent Participation:** Encourages miners to stay with the pool long-term, ensuring a stable and reliable mining operation.
* **Potential for Higher Earnings:** Steady contributions can lead to higher cumulative earnings over time than other reward models.
* **Lower Fees:** Reduced pool fees compared to PPS pools, resulting in more of the block reward being passed on to miners.

Disadvantages of PPLNS
----------------------

* **Earnings Variability:** Rewards can be inconsistent, especially in pools with smaller hash rates or less frequent block discoveries.
* **Challenges for New Miners:** New or casual miners may find it difficult to earn stable payouts, as rewards depend on sustained contributions within the 'N' share window.
* **Initial Delay in Payouts:**Â New miners might not receive their first payout until they have contributed enough shares within the 'N' window.

Comparison to Other Reward Methods
----------------------------------

### PPLNS vs Pay-Per-Share (PPS)

While PPS provides a fixed payout for each share submitted, PPLNS distributes rewards based on recent share contributions. This results in lower fees for PPLNS pools. PPLNS introduces variable rewards tied to poor performance. In contrast, PPS offers predictable income but at a higher cost to the pool.

### PPLNS vs SOLO Mining

SOLO mining allows individual miners to earn the entire block reward. However, it has high variability and resource requirements. In contrast, PPLNS offers more consistent, albeit smaller, payouts by pooling resources.

Rewards are distributed based on recent contributions, making PPLNS more suitable for miners with limited computational power seeking steady income.

Case Studies
------------

### Alexâ€™s Journey with PPLNS

Alex, a software engineer with a modest mining setup, joined a PPLNS pool to gain consistent payouts and leverage community support. Over a year, his steady contributions yielded regular earnings and a decent return on investment. This highlights PPLNS's suitability for miners with limited computational power.

### Graceâ€™s SOLO Mining Adventure

Grace, an IT entrepreneur with substantial mining resources, opted for SOLO mining to capture full block rewards. Despite initial delays and high variability, her powerful setup eventually resulted in significant earnings. This demonstrates the high-risk, high-reward nature of SOLO mining compared to PPLNS.

Who Should Use PPLNS?
---------------------

PPLNS is ideal for miners who:

* **Prefer Long-Term Mining:** Those seeking consistent participation and steady payouts over time.
* **Accept Earnings Variance:** Miners willing to handle fluctuations in rewards for the potential of higher returns.
* **Aim to Avoid Higher Fees:** Individuals looking to minimize costs associated with fixed-payment models like PPS.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Reward Distribution Based on Recent Shares:** PPLNS rewards miners based on the number of shares they contribute within the last 'N' shares before a block is mined. This ensures fairness and promotes consistent participation.
* **Variable Payouts:** Earnings can fluctuate depending on the pool's success in finding blocks. This introduces variability but may lead to higher rewards over time.
* **Lower Pool Fees:** Compared to fixed-payment models like PPS, PPLNS pools often have lower fees. This allows miners to retain more of the block rewards.
* **Encourages Long-Term Commitment:** By rewarding sustained contributions, PPLNS reduces pool hopping and fosters a more stable and reliable mining environment.
