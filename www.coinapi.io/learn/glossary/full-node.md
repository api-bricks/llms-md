### Full Node

A full node is a computer that downloads and stores a complete copy of a blockchain's entire transaction history, independently verifies all transactions and blocks against the network's consensus rules, and helps maintain network security and decentralization by relaying transactions to other nodes.

What is Full Node?
------------------

A full node is a fundamental component of a [blockchain](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/blockchain) network. It is specifically designed to download and store the entire history of a blockchain. These nodes meticulously observe and enforce the network's rules. They ensure the integrity and security of every transaction recorded on the blockchain. Unlike lightweight nodes, which only retain a subset of the blockchain data, full nodes maintain a complete and self-sufficient ledger. This makes them essential for the decentralized nature of blockchain systems.

How a Full Node Works
---------------------

Full nodes operate by downloading every block and transaction from the inception of the blockchain. They validate each one against the network's consensus rules. Full nodes participate in the blockchain's governance by verifying new transactions and blocks using [mechanisms](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/consensus-mechanism) like **Proof of Work** or **Proof of Stake**. When a new transaction is submitted, full nodes validate its legitimacy. Once consensus is reached, they add it to the blockchain. This comprehensive validation process ensures that only legitimate transactions are recorded. It prevents issues like double-spending and inflation.

Benefits of Running a Full Node
-------------------------------

Operating a full node provides several advantages:

* **Security**: Full nodes offer maximum security by independently verifying all transactions and blocks. This protects against fraudulent activities and network attacks.
* **Privacy**: By downloading the entire blockchain, full nodes do not rely on third-party servers. This minimizes the exposure of user data and enhances privacy.
* **Decentralization**: The presence of numerous full nodes contributes to the network's decentralization. This makes the network more resilient against failures and centralized control.
* **Economic Strength**: Full nodes enforce consensus rules autonomously. This ensures the economic integrity of the blockchain and prevents malicious alterations by miners or other entities.

Practical Applications
----------------------

Full nodes are crucial for various use cases, including:

* **Trustless Transactions**: Users can transact with complete assurance that all rules are enforced without relying on intermediaries.
* **Network Services**: Full nodes provide essential services such as transaction filtering, block propagation, and historical data access to other network participants.
* **Blockchain Maintenance**: In the event of a catastrophic failure, full nodes can reconstruct the entire blockchain. This ensures the network's continuity and reliability.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Comprehensive Validation**: Full nodes download and verify the entire blockchain. This ensures that all transactions adhere to the network's consensus rules, maintaining the blockchain's integrity and preventing fraudulent activities.
* **Enhanced Security and Privacy**: By independently verifying transactions and not relying on third-party servers, full nodes provide maximum security and protect user privacy. This autonomy safeguards against potential network attacks and data exposure.
* **Support for Decentralization**: The operation of numerous full nodes across the network fosters decentralization. This makes the blockchain more resilient to failures and reduces the risk of centralized control or manipulation.
* **Essential for Network Services and Maintenance**: Full nodes play a pivotal role in providing essential network services, such as transaction filtering and block propagation. Additionally, they are vital for blockchain maintenance, enabling the network to recover and continue functioning in the event of catastrophic failures.
