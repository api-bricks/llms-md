### Fungible Token

A fungible token is a digital asset where each unit is identical to and interchangeable with every other unit, just like how one dollar bill has the same value and can be exchanged for any other dollar bill. Common examples include cryptocurrencies.

Fungible - meaning
------------------

Fungible means any form of money or commodity that can be replaced with an equal value of the same item. It comes from the Latin verb "fungi," meaning "to perform." Fungibility has been essential in economics and trading throughout history. In [**blockchain**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/blockchain) and cryptocurrencies, fungible tokens are non-unique digital [assets](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/assets) that are interchangeable and hold the same value. This makes them ideal for use as mediums of exchange or stores of value. Unlike [**non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/non-fungible-token), which represent unique items, fungible tokens can be divided and exchanged without any loss of value or functionality.

Types of Tokens
---------------

In the blockchain ecosystem, tokens are categorized into **fungible** and **non-fungible**. Fungible tokens include **utility tokens**, which grant access to blockchain-based services, and **security tokens**, which represent stocks or shares in digital form. These tokens are designed to be interchangeable, ensuring consistent value across transactions. On the other hand, **NFTs** are unique and indivisible. They are often used to represent digital art, collectibles, or other one-of-a-kind items.

Difference Between Crypto Coins and Tokens
------------------------------------------

Crypto coinsare native to their respective blockchains. They are used primarily as mediums of exchange, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Coins are usually [mined](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/mining) through the blockchain's [consensus mechanism](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/consensus-mechanism) and have a specified total supply. Tokens, however, are created on existing blockchains via [smart contracts](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/smart-contract). They can represent various digital assets or utilities. Unlike coins, tokens do not require mining and can have an unlimited supply. This allows for more flexibility in their applications.

Can Coins Also Be Non-Fungible?
-------------------------------

Generally, crypto coins are designed to be fungible. They serve as mediums of exchange with interchangeable value. However, there exists a subset known as numismatic coins. These possess unique characteristics or identifiers, making them non-fungible. These coins resemble blockchain blocks, each with distinct hash values. They are not interchangeable on a one-to-one basis. Despite their rarity, non-fungible coins are an exception in the cryptocurrency landscape.

Difference Between Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens
---------------------------------------------------

The main difference between fungible tokens and NFTs is their interchangeability and uniqueness. Fungible tokens are identical in value and can be easily exchanged, e.g., Bitcoin, ERC-20 tokens. Each unit holds the same value and functionality, making them suitable for transactions and as a store of value. NFTs, such as those adhering to the ERC-721 standard, are unique and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis. Each NFT has distinct characteristics, making them ideal for representing ownership of specific digital or physical assets like artworks, collectibles, or real estate.

Examples of Fungible Tokens
---------------------------

A prominent example of fungible tokens is Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens. They are widely used for various applications within the blockchain ecosystem. Stablecoins, a subset of ERC-20 tokens, maintain a fixed value and are interchangeable. This makes them highly tradable and reliable for transactions. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) also exemplify fungible tokens. Each unit holds the same value and can be seamlessly exchanged without impacting their functionality.

Best Analogy to Understand Fungible Tokens
------------------------------------------

A simple analogy for fungible tokens is traditional currency. For example, if Person A borrows $50 from Person B, it doesn't matter if Person A repays with a different $50 bill or with two $20 and one $10 bills. The value remains consistent and interchangeable, much like fungible tokens in the blockchain world. This interchangeability ensures each unit holds the same value, facilitating seamless transactions and exchanges.

Things to Remember
------------------

* **Fungibility Defined**: Fungible tokens are interchangeable digital assets that hold identical value. They are ideal for use as mediums of exchange or stores of value. Unlike **NFTs**, they can be seamlessly divided and exchanged without any loss of value.
* **Types of Tokens**: The blockchain ecosystem categorizes tokens into fungible and non-fungible. Fungible tokens include **utility tokens** and **security tokens**, designed to be interchangeable. NFTs represent unique items like digital art or collectibles.
* **Crypto Coins vs Tokens**: Crypto coins are native to their blockchains. They are used primarily as mediums of exchange. Tokens are created on existing blockchains via smart contracts and represent a wide range of digital assets or utilities.
* **Use Cases and Examples**: Examples of fungible tokens include Ethereum's **ERC-20 tokens**, stablecoins, **Bitcoin (BTC)**, and **Ether (ETH)**. They are used for transactions, investments, [**DeFi**](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance) activities, and accessing blockchain-based services.
