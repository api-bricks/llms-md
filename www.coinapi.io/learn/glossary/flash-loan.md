### Flash Loan

A flash loan is a type of uncollateralized loan in DeFi (decentralized finance) where a user can borrow any amount of assets without providing collateral, as long as the loan is borrowed and repaid within the same blockchain transaction.

What is Flash Loan?
-------------------

A flash loan is an uncollateralized loan in the [Decentralized Finance (DeFi)](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance) ecosystem. It allows users to borrow assets without providing upfront collateral. The borrowed amount plus a small fee must be returned within the same [blockchain](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/blockchain) transaction. If the loan is not repaid in time, the entire transaction is reverted. This mechanism ensures the lender does not incur any loss.

How Flash Loans Work
--------------------

Flash loans operate through [smart contracts](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/smart-contract) on blockchain platforms like Ethereum. When a user initiates a flash loan, the smart contract checks the availability of the requested funds. The borrower has a brief execution window - typically a few seconds - to use the borrowed assets for financial operations such as trading or arbitrage. Before the transaction concludes, the borrower must repay the loan along with any applicable fees. If repayment is not completed within the same transaction, the smart contract automatically reverses all actions, nullifying the loan.

Use Cases of Flash Loans
------------------------

Flash loans enable various financial strategies in DeFi:

* **Arbitrage:** Taking advantage of price differences of an asset across different exchanges to generate profit.
* **Liquidations:** Assisting in the liquidation of undercollateralized loans by providing the capital to repay and seize collateral.
* **Collateral Swaps:** Allowing users to change their collateral type without multiple transactions by borrowing and repaying within a single transaction.
* **Leveraged Positions:** Enabling leveraged trading positions by borrowing additional funds to increase exposure to certain assets.

Flash Loans vs. Traditional Loans
---------------------------------

Unlike traditional loans, which require collateral and have extended repayment periods, flash loans are unsecured and must be repaid within the same blockchain transaction. Traditional loans can last years and involve collateral that the lender can seize if the borrower defaults. In contrast, flash loans rely on the atomic nature of blockchain transactions to ensure repayment. This makes defaults virtually impossible because the entire transaction is reverted if the loan is not repaid promptly.

Security Considerations and Risks
---------------------------------

While flash loans offer new financial opportunities, they also introduce potential security risks:

* **Price Oracle Attacks:** Malicious actors can manipulate price oracles using flash loans to exploit vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols. This allows them to borrow more than they should or drain funds from smart contracts.
* **Protocol Vulnerabilities:** Flash loans can expose weaknesses in DeFi protocols. This highlights the need for strong smart contract security and decentralized oracle solutions.

Mitigating Risks with Decentralized Oracles
-------------------------------------------

To prevent flash loan-related attacks, DeFi protocols can use decentralized [oracle networks](https://www.coinapi.io/learn/glossary/blockchain-oracle) like Chainlink. These oracles aggregate price data from multiple sources. This ensures more accurate and tamper-resistant price feeds. By relying on decentralized oracles, protocols can avoid single-source price manipulation. This enhances their overall security against flash loan exploits.

Key Takeaways
-------------

* **Uncollateralized and Instant Repayment:** Flash loans do not require collateral and must be repaid within the same blockchain transaction. This mechanism ensures that lenders do not face any loss.
* **Powered by Smart Contracts:** These loans operate through smart contracts. The use of smart contracts makes the transaction atomic. This means it must either fully complete or not occur at all.
* **Diverse Use Cases:** Flash loans support various financial strategies including arbitrage, liquidations, collateral swaps, and leveraged positions. This versatility makes them a valuable tool in the DeFi ecosystem.
* **Security Risks and Mitigations:** While flash loans offer significant benefits, they present security risks such as price oracle manipulation and protocol vulnerabilities. Using decentralized oracle networks like Chainlink can mitigate these risks by providing secure and reliable price data.
