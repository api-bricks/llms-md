(b)based on unlimited Data Sources and Modules;  
  
as chosen by you when setting up the Subscription or Order.  
  
**4.3. Fair Usage.** Your usage of the Cloud Services is governed by our Acceptable Usage Policy.  
  
**4.4. Security of Your Data.** We implement and maintain security measures to help protect the Cloud Services and Your Data from security attacks. However, you acknowledge and agree that as a consequence of the inherent nature of the Cloud Services, Your Data will often be transported over networks that are not owned or operated by us, and that we are not responsible for any of Your Data that is lost, intercepted, altered or stored across such networks, except to the extent caused by our negligence or intentional misconduct. You acknowledge that we are unable to guarantee complete security or confidentiality of Your Data or guarantee that third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers. We are General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant: if we discover or are made aware that any of Your Data has been intercepted, we will follow the GDPR reporting guidelines if the intercepted data may have contained any personally identifiable information.  
  
**4.5.

We will provide thirty (30) days❜ notice and provide reasonable opportunity for you to correct your breach prior to removing Your Data, but we may also suspend your access immediately without notice if we deem it necessary to protect the Cloud Services, security of other customers or to comply with any law or regulation. We have no liability to you for removing or deleting Your Data from or suspending your access to any Cloud Services if you violate this Agreement, our Acceptable Use Policy or any law or regulation.

(b)software malfunctions;  
(c)periodic maintenance procedures or repairs which Company mayundertake from time to time; and/or,  
(d)causes beyond the reasonable control of Company and/or not reasonably foreseeable by Company.  
  
**4.8 Service Level Agreement.** Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Services available **99.9%** of time, measured monthly (“Monthly Uptime Percentage”). Further, any downtime resulting from outages of third party connections or utilities or other reasons beyond Company❜s control will also be excluded from any such calculation. Customer's sole and exclusive remedy, and Company's entire liability, in connection with Service availability shall be that in the event Company does not meet the Monthly Uptime Percentage in given calendar month, Customer will be eligible to receive a Service Credit. “Unavailable Time” means the Company API is not available for use according to third party performance and monitoring services contracted by Company (the “Monitoring Service”). The Monitoring Service reports of availability will be accessible via the website operated by the third party. "Monthly Uptime Percentage" is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of continuous 1 minute periods during the Service Month in which the Company API was in a state of “Unavailable Time” as identified by Monitoring Service. Availability will be measured by checking the successful HTTP response of the API for the REST and WebSocket protocols on at least one endpoint delivered to the Customer. For a calendar month where the Uptime Monthly Percentage, as identified by Monitoring Service, Company, at its sole discretion after confirming the nature and accuracy of the Unavailable Time, will credit Customer a percentage of that month❜s billings calculated as the average monthly value of the Service Fees, as defined by this table:

+---------------------------+---------------------------+| Monthly Uptime Percentage | Service Credit Percentage |+---------------------------+---------------------------+| >= 99.9% | 0% || < 99.9% and >= 99.0% | 5% || < 99.0% | 10% |+---------------------------+---------------------------+

To receive downtime credit, Customer must submit a ticket via the Support Portal within 30 days from the time of downtime, and failure to provide such notice will forfeit the right to receive downtime credit. The ticket must include:  
  
(a)"SLA Claim" as the subject of the ticket;  
(b)the dates and times of the Unavailable Time for which Customer are requesting credit; and  
(c)any applicable information that documents the claimed outage. Such credits may not be redeemed for cash.  
  
**4.9 Right to Change Content or Format.** You acknowledge that Company may from time to time, and in its sole discretion, update or change the content or format of the Services. Company shall strive to provide reasonable advance notification of such changes; however, from time to time sudden changes in currency names, codes, and/or values occur in financial markets, and since Company strives to accurately reflect these changes, significant advance notice is not always possible.  
**4.10. Usage Beyond Subscription Limits.** If you exceed the limits of your subscription for Cloud Services, you agree to pay for the excess usage through Usage Credits as described in Section 2.6. We reserve the right to suspend services if Usage Credit charges are not paid when due.
