Currencies API Guide: Real-Time and Historical Exchange Rate Data
=================================================================

![featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fxpx4czto%2Fproduction%2F7e0c05503485d22086ba6fc3ddb791b6ff932707-640x426.jpg%3Frect%3D0%2C74%2C640%2C278%26w%3D920%26h%3D400&w=1920&q=75)

**Why Exchange Rate Data Matters**
----------------------------------

Access to consistent and accurate exchange rates is critical for trading platforms, payment processors, fintech applications, and analytics systems. Whether you're supporting crypto-fiat conversions, cross-border payments, or historical auditing, reliable data is essential for precision, compliance, and performance.

This guide covers how the Currencies API delivers both real-time and historical FX data — along with how to use it across various applications.

**What Are Exchange Rates?**
----------------------------

Exchange rates define the value of one currency relative to another. This applies to:

* Crypto-to-crypto pairs (e.g., ETH/BTC)
* Crypto-to-fiat pairs (e.g., BTC/USD)
* Fiat-to-fiat pairs (e.g., EUR/JPY)

Rates are influenced by trading volume, [market depth](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/market-depth), exchange-specific pricing models, regulations, and market behavior.

**Why Rates Differ Between Platforms**
--------------------------------------

Exchange rate discrepancies occur due to:

* Differing order book liquidity across exchanges
* Fee structures and spreads applied by platforms
* Geographic and regulatory constraints
* Timing differences and data quality
* Arbitrage behavior and user demand

A unified API that aggregates and normalizes data helps maintain consistency across use cases.

**Common Use Cases for Exchange Rate Data**
-------------------------------------------

Currencies API supports a wide range of real-world applications across multiple industries:

* **Remittance Services:** Deliver accurate real-time FX rates for money transfers. Use historical data for audits, dispute resolution, and regulatory reporting.
* **Travel & Hospitality:** Convert booking prices in real time at checkout. Use timestamped historical rates for refunds, reconciliations, and multi-currency reporting.
* **E-commerce & Marketplaces:** Display prices in local currencies based on current FX rates. Automate currency conversion for global product catalogs and billing systems.
* **Trading & Investment Platforms:** Feed real-time rates into trading UIs, backtesting tools, and portfolio trackers. Support both fiat and crypto markets.
* **DeFi & Web3:** Integrate live FX rates into smart contracts, on-chain oracles, and liquidity management tools.
* **Financial Services & Banking:** Support multi-currency wallets, payment processing, and compliance tools with accurate and auditable exchange rates.

**Developer Best Practices**
----------------------------

When working with exchange rate data:

* Error handling: Implement fallback logic in case of downtime or latency
* Rate limits: Throttle requests to match your plan
* Data verification: Ensure pricing accuracy before using in financial workflows
