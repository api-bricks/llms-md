### Detailed Applications for Developers

With the newly added currencies, you can build more globally-aware and functional applications. Our real time and historical APIs offer the tools to integrate a wide array of currency data for various use cases.

#### E-commerce and Global Marketplaces üõçÔ∏è

You can create a more localized shopping experience for international customers.

* **Dynamic Pricing**: Use the real-time endpoint `/v1/exchangerate/{asset_id_base}/{asset_id_quote}`to instantly convert prices into a customer's local currency, such as the Uruguayan Peso (UYU) or Fiji Dollar (FJD). This reduces friction at checkout and can improve conversion rates.
* **Multi-Currency Invoicing**: Generate invoices in a client's native currency, like the Algerian Dinar (DZD) or Moroccan Dirham (MAD). You can pull the current exchange rate at the moment of invoice creation to ensure accuracy.

#### Financial Dashboards and Portfolio Trackers üìä

Build applications that provide a holistic view of assets held in multiple currencies.

* **Unified Portfolio Value**: A user may hold assets in both US Dollars and Russian Rubles (RUB). Your application can use the real-time API to fetch the latest `USD/RUB` rate and present the total portfolio value in a single, user-selected currency.
* **Profit & Loss (P&L) Attribution**: For more advanced platforms, you can use historical data to show how much of a portfolio's P&L is due to asset performance versus currency fluctuations.

#### Travel and Expense Management Apps ‚úàÔ∏è

Develop tools that simplify expense tracking for international business or leisure travelers.

* **Accurate Expense Reporting**: Use the historical endpoint `/v1/exchangerate/{asset_id_base}/{asset_id_quote}/history` to retrieve the specific exchange rate for the day a transaction was made. This ensures an employee's expenses in Honduran Lempira (HNL) or Kenyan Shillings (KES) are converted back to the company's base currency with precision.
* **Budgeting Assistance**: Your app could use real-time rates to help travelers budget for their trips, providing live estimates of costs in their home currency as they spend.

### Expanded Opportunities for Traders and Business Users

This currency expansion opens up new markets for analysis, trading, and strategic business decisions, especially in emerging economies.

#### Traders and Financial Analysts üìà

The addition of more exotic currencies provides a richer dataset for finding new opportunities and refining strategies.

* **Backtesting on New Pairs**: Analysts can now rigorously backtest trading models on previously unavailable currency pairs. Using the `/v1/exchangerate/{asset_id_base}/{asset_id_quote}/history` endpoint, you can download years of detailed [OHLCV](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/ohlcv) timeseries data. For instance, you could test a [volatility](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/volatility)-based strategy on the `USD/ZMW` (Zambian Kwacha) pair, adjusting the `period_id` from `1DAY` down to `1HRS` to find the most effective timeframe.
* **Cross-Rate Analysis**: Use the `/v1/exchangerate/{asset_id_base}` endpoint to fetch all available rates against a single base currency like the Euro. By filtering for specific quote assets (`filter_asset_id`) like the Rwandan Franc (RWF), Burundi Franc (BIF), and Ugandan Shilling (UGX), you can perform regional analysis to identify macroeconomic trends or arbitrage opportunities.

#### Corporate Finance and Strategy üè¢

For businesses with global operations, this data is critical for financial planning and risk management.

* **Foreign Exchange (FX) Risk Hedging**: A multinational corporation with revenues in a volatile currency like the Nigerian Naira (NGN) can use historical data to model its FX exposure. This analysis helps the treasury department decide on the appropriate hedging instruments to protect profits from adverse currency movements.
* **International Market Analysis**: Before entering a new market, such as Vietnam or Pakistan, a strategy team can analyze the long-term stability and trends of the Vietnamese Dong (VND) or Pakistani Rupee (PKR) against their home currency. This provides insight into the potential economic risks and rewards of expansion. Retrieving historical data gives a clear picture of seasonal trends and long-term volatility.

This expansion brings our total number of supported fiat currencies to **over 250** historical and present currencies, providing one of the most comprehensive currency data feeds available. The geographical coverage now deeply integrates markets across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Americas, and Oceania. We remain committed to providing the tools you need to operate effectively in a global marketplace and will continue to broaden our data offerings.
