FinFeed API is compatible with MCP
==================================

![featured image](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fxpx4czto%2Fproduction%2Fb9058ff6698f7f327be6f5628681e35092e857a9-920x400.png%3Fw%3D920%26h%3D400&w=1920&q=75)

Let’s be real. Integrating financial data should be as fun as snapping Lego bricks together. But for most developers, connecting market and regulatory APIs to a new AI app feels more like assembling flat-pack furniture with the instructions missing.

Well, it’s time to ditch the Allen key. We’re thrilled to announce that the entire suite of FinFeedAPI products now supports the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. This is a fancy way of saying we’ve taught our APIs to speak the language of AI, making your life a whole lot easier.

#### **So, What's This MCP Magic?**

Think of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a universal translator for our APIs. It creates a super-smart instruction manual that allows AI models, bots, and other automated tools to discover and understand how to use all of our financial data—no custom coding needed on your end.

Your AI can now directly tap into FinFeedAPI's treasure trove of financial data, including:

* **[SEC](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/sec) Filings:** Let your AI dig into `8-K`, `10-K`, and `10-Q` forms. It can query filings by ticker or date and even perform full-text searches to find exactly what it needs.
* **U.S. Stock Data:** Get programmatic access to historical [OHLCV](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/ohlcv) data, live trades, and the kind of deep order book data (Level 1, 2, and 3) that quants dream about.
* **Foreign Exchange (FX) Data:** Your agent can pull both real-time and historical exchange rates for a huge list of currency pairs.

With MCP, your AI agent can explore these endpoints on its own and figure out how to get the data it needs. It’s not just about making our APIs easier to use; it’s about giving your AI the keys to automate serious financial tasks.

#### **From Frustration to Automation**

Remember the bad old days?

* Reading documentation until your eyes glazed over.
* Writing custom parsers for every different data source.
* Watching your carefully crafted code break with the smallest API update.

Yeah, we’re over it. With FinFeedAPI's new MCP integration, your AI just *gets it*. It sees the data available, understands how to ask for it, and gets to work.

**Here’s what this means for you:**

* **Plug-and-Play AI:** Hook our data directly into your AI apps and chat models with virtually zero custom code. Your agent can figure out the rest.
* **Built to Last:** As we add new features—like data for new SEC forms or more stock metrics—your agent will discover them automatically. No more maintenance headaches.
* **Rock-Solid Reliability:** The protocol helps catch errors before they cause problems, leading to far more stable integrations.
* **Simple and Consistent:** Your API keys work just like they always have, but now you have one consistent way to interact with all our products.

#### **Okay, But What Can I Actually *Build* With This?**

Fair question! Here are a few ideas to get you started:

* **Build an AI Research Analyst:** Picture an agent that you give a stock [ticke](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/ticker)r to. It uses our `/v1/filings` endpoint to find the latest 10-K report, then uses `/v1/extractor` to pull the "Risk Factors" section, and finally asks an LLM to summarize potential red flags. All in a matter of seconds.
* **Create an Automated Market Watchdog:** How about a bot that watches a stock’s daily price and volume using the `'/v1/ohlcv/.../history'` endpoint? It could simultaneously monitor intraday trades with `'/v1/native/iex/trade/{symbol}'` to spot unusual activity the moment it happens.
* **Unleash an FX Opportunity Bot:** An agent could constantly compare real-time currency rates from our `'/v1/exchangerate/{asset_id_base}'` endpoint with historical data to find potential arbitrage opportunities while you’re still sipping your morning coffee.

#### **Get Your Agent Hooked Up**

Getting started is a piece of cake. Just point your agent, bot, or application to the right FinFeedAPI endpoint with your API key.

Here’s a simple setup:

```
1{
2  "FinFeedAPI-SEC": {
3    "url": "https://api.sec.finfeedapi.com",
4    "headers": {
5      "Authorization": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
6    }
7  },
8  "FinFeedAPI-Stock": {
9    "url": "https://api-historical.stock.finfeedapi.com",
10    "headers": {
11      "Authorization": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
12    }
13  },
14  "FinFeedAPI-FX-Realtime": {
15    "url": "https://api-realtime.fx.finfeedapi.com",
16    "headers": {
17      "Authorization": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
18    }
19  },
20  "FinFeedAPI-FX-Historical": {
21    "url": "https://api-historical.fx.finfeedapi.com",
22    "headers": {
23      "Authorization": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
24    }
25  }
26}
```
