### Transparent, scalable, usage-based pricing

Rates Usage

#### Rates Usage

Rates are prices of exchange rate; either downloaded via REST API or received via WebSocket API. Rate is always a single price for the specific asset pair. One REST API endpoint can deliver multiple prices for the same or multiple asset pairs. Single OHLCV message for specific timestamp having multiple prices in a single message but it's billed as one rate as all the rates (open, high, low, close) are related to the same symbol. Historical OHLCV or timeseries data for specific asset pairs on 1DAY intervals for a year will be billed as 365 rates.

Pricing is tiered based on your daily usage:

* Calculated per 100 rates
* Tiers reset daily
* Rates decrease as usage increases
* Usage covered by the committed-usage plan quota is counted

Higher volume users automatically benefit from lower rates. See the table below for specific pricing tiers.

Example 1 - Pay As You Go

* Let's say you will fetch 250 rates in one day
* The first 100 rates will be priced at $0.50
* The next 100 rates will be priced at $0.40
* The final 50 rates will be priced at $0.30
* The total cost will be $1.20

Example 2 - PRO with Pay As You Go

* Let's say you will use 150,000 rates in one day while having active PRO subscription
* The PRO plan has a limit of 100,00 rates / day.
* The first 100,000 rates will not be charged as they are within the plan quota.
* The final 50,000 rates will be priced at $0.25 / 1k rates = $12.50
* The total cost for this day will be $12.50 on top of the PRO subscription

Example 3 - Growth with REST API and WebSocket connections

* Let's say that every 10 seconds you send a request to the REST API for BTC/USD and ETH/EUR. Additionally, you have two WebSocket connections with which you fetch “LTC/EUR” at an interval of 150ms. How to calculate your usage?
* REST API: 6\*60\*24\*2= 17280 rates  
  Explanation: 6\*60\*24 (6 times every minute for 24 hours), 2 (you ask about two trading pairs)
* WebSocket: 24 \* 60 \* 60 \* 1000 / 150 \* 1 \* 2 = 1,152,000  
  Explanation: 24 \* 60 \* 60 \* 1000 (number of milliseconds in a day), 150 (update interval), 1 (one trading pair), 2 (two connections)
* The final rate usage will be 1169280 (1,152,000 + 17280)
