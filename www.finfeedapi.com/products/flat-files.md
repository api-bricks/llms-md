### MCP compability for seamless data integration

FinFeedAPI supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open specification that makes our financial data APIs machine-readable. This allows AI models, autonomous agents, and next-generation crypto apps to programmatically discover and integrate our data with little to no custom code.

Key benefits for users include:

* **Easy AI Integration:** Directly connect FinFeedAPI data to large language models (LLMs) and AI agents.
* **Simplified Development:** Access all FinFeedAPI services through a single, unified MCP endpoint, eliminating the need for custom wrappers.
* **Increased Reliability:** Schema-level validation catches errors and ensures more robust integrations.
* **Future-Proof Design:** New services and endpoints are automatically discovered by your applications without requiring client-side updates.
