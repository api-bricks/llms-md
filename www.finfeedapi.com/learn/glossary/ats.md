### ATS

An Alternative Trading System (ATS) is a non-exchange trading venue that matches buyers and sellers of securities outside of traditional stock exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. While not officially classified as exchanges, ATSs operate under regulatory oversight and provide an alternative way to trade ‚Äî often with greater speed, lower cost, or added privacy.

Many dark pools, electronic communication networks (ECNs), and broker-dealer platforms are categorized as ATSs. Their role in modern markets has grown significantly, especially as **electronic and algorithmic trading** has become more prevalent.

‚öôÔ∏è How ATSs Work
----------------

ATSs facilitate the trading of stocks, bonds, or other securities by **electronically matching orders**, often using **proprietary algorithms or matching engines**. Unlike public exchanges, ATSs usually don‚Äôt display full order books or provide the same level of transparency.

Trades on ATSs are often:

* **Executed anonymously**, which can help reduce market impact.
* **Faster and more flexible**, particularly for institutional traders.
* **Operated by broker-dealers, investment banks, or fintech firms**.

Orders may be routed to ATSs automatically through brokers, especially when trying to find the best price or minimize trading costs.

üõ°Ô∏è Regulation and Oversight
---------------------------

Although ATSs are not formal exchanges, they are **regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ([SEC](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/sec))** and must:

* **Register as broker-dealers**
* **File Form ATS**, disclosing their operations and policies
* **Comply with fair access and best execution rules**
* Be monitored for **manipulative practices or conflicts of interest**

The SEC treats ATSs as part of the broader U.S. market structure ‚Äî allowing for innovation while ensuring **investor protection and fair play**.

üß† Why ATSs Matter
-----------------

ATSs have become an essential part of how modern markets function, handling a significant portion of daily trading volume ‚Äî especially in **high-frequency, institutional, and dark pool activity**.

Their benefits include:

* **Lower fees and latency** for fast trades
* **Customizable order types** for institutional clients
* **Privacy for large block trades**
* **Reduced market impact** compared to public exchanges

However, their growth has raised concerns around **market fragmentation**, **lack of pre-trade transparency**, and **unequal access** for different market participants.

üß† Things to Remember
--------------------

* An **ATS is a private platform** for trading securities, operating outside of traditional exchanges but under SEC oversight.
* It serves as the foundation for **dark pools**, **ECNs**, and other alternative liquidity sources.
* ATSs are geared toward **institutional and high-volume traders**, offering anonymity and custom features.
* While beneficial for speed and efficiency, they have prompted regulatory discussions about **transparency and fairness** in market structure.

ATSs are where much of the modern market‚Äôs **‚Äúinvisible‚Äù trading takes place** ‚Äî they‚Äôre fast, flexible, and often hidden from public view, but they play a massive role in shaping price discovery and liquidity across global markets.
