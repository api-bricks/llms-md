### Dark pool trading

Dark pools are private, non-public trading venues where large institutional investors can buy or sell large blocks of securities without immediately revealing their intentions to the wider market. Unlike traditional stock exchanges, dark pools do not display order books to the public ‚Äî hence the term ‚Äúdark.‚Äù

These platforms were originally created to allow big trades (often millions of dollars in value) to happen **quietly**, reducing the risk of **price impact** ‚Äî where the act of placing a large order causes the market to move unfavorably.

‚öôÔ∏è How Dark Pools Work
----------------------

When a large investor ‚Äî like a pension fund, mutual fund, or hedge fund ‚Äî wants to make a sizable trade, executing it on a public exchange could move the market against them. In a dark pool, that order is **matched privately** with a counterparty, typically through an algorithm, without being exposed to the public order book.

* **Orders are not visible** before execution.
* **Trade details** (like price and volume) are **reported after the transaction**, often with a short delay.
* Many dark pools are operated by **investment banks, broker-dealers, or exchanges**.

For example, if a firm wants to sell 500,000 shares of a stock, doing so on the open market might trigger a selloff. In a dark pool, they may be able to execute that trade **in full or in parts** without alerting other traders.

üõ°Ô∏è Regulation and Transparency
------------------------------

Dark pools are **legal** and regulated in the U.S. by the **Securities and Exchange Commission ([SEC](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/sec))**, but they operate under **less stringent transparency rules** than public exchanges.

Key points:

* They are classified as **Alternative Trading Systems (ATS)** and must register with the SEC.
* Regulators monitor dark pools for **fair dealing**, **best execution**, and **conflicts of interest**.
* Recent reforms have focused on increasing **post-trade transparency** and **limiting abusive practices**, such as **information leakage** or unfair matching.

While dark pools serve a legitimate purpose, critics argue that they can **fragment markets** and reduce the transparency that public exchanges offer.

üß† Things to Remember
--------------------

* **Dark pools are private trading venues**, designed to execute large orders discreetly.
* They help institutional investors **minimize price impact and slippage** when trading at scale.
* Trades in dark pools are **not visible beforehand**, but are typically reported shortly after execution.
* While they offer advantages in size and stealth, they also raise concerns around **market fairness** and **transparency**.
* As a retail trader, you may not interact directly with dark pools, but your broker could route orders through them.
