### Risk/Reward ratio

The Risk/Reward (R/R) ratio is a measure that compares how much you're willing to risk on a trade to how much you expect to gain.

‚öñÔ∏è Definition
-------------

The **Risk/Reward Ratio (R/R ratio)** is a simple but powerful tool used by traders and investors to measure the **potential gain of a trade compared to the possible loss**. It helps answer a basic but critical question:

> *Is this trade worth the risk I'm taking?*

If you‚Äôre risking $100 to potentially make $300, your risk/reward ratio is **1:3** ‚Äî meaning you're risking 1 unit to gain 3.

üîç Importance
------------

Understanding the risk/reward ratio is essential for **making smart, strategic decisions in the market**. Even profitable trades can lead to losses over time if the risk isn‚Äôt properly managed. The R/R ratio forces traders to think critically about both sides of a trade ‚Äî not just what they could gain, but what they could lose.

More importantly, consistent use of the R/R ratio can shift your mindset from chasing profits to managing risk ‚Äî which is **how long-term success in trading is built**.

üõ†Ô∏è Practical Applications
-------------------------

Before entering a trade, many traders calculate their R/R ratio by identifying two key levels:

* **Stop-loss**: Where you‚Äôll exit the trade if it goes against you ‚Äî this defines your **risk**.
* **Target price**: Where you‚Äôll take profits ‚Äî this defines your **reward**.

For example, if you're buying a stock at $50:

* Stop-loss at $48 = $2 risk
* Target at $56 = $6 reward
* R/R = 2:6 = **1:3**

This helps you decide if the potential gain is worth the downside. It‚Äôs especially useful when comparing multiple trade setups ‚Äî allowing you to pick those with the most favorable payoff profiles.

üéØ Optimal R/R Ratios
--------------------

There‚Äôs no single ‚Äúperfect‚Äù ratio, but many successful traders aim for a **minimum of 1:2 or 1:3** ‚Äî risking $1 to potentially make $2 or $3. This way, even if only **40‚Äì50%** of your trades are winners, you can still be profitable over time.

Some strategies with higher win rates may tolerate lower R/R ratios (like 1:1), while high-risk trades with lower win rates need higher rewards (like 1:4 or more) to be sustainable.

The key is consistency: your strategy should align the R/R ratio with your **win rate**, **market conditions**, and **personal risk tolerance**.

üõ°Ô∏è Managing Risk with the R/R Ratio
-----------------------------------

The R/R ratio is a key part of **position sizing and risk management**. Once you know how much you're willing to lose on a trade (e.g., 1% of your portfolio), you can use the R/R ratio to determine **how many shares or contracts to trade**.

It also helps remove emotion from the equation. With a planned exit on both sides of the trade, you're less likely to panic when prices move unexpectedly. This encourages **discipline, structure, and objectivity**, especially in volatile markets.

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
--------------

While the R/R ratio is a helpful planning tool, it **doesn‚Äôt guarantee success**. The market might hit your stop-loss before reaching your target, or reverse entirely after you exit. Also, it doesn‚Äôt account for **probability** ‚Äî a trade with a 1:5 ratio might look great on paper but only have a 10% chance of hitting the target.

Relying on R/R alone, without considering **market context, [volatility](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/volatility), and probability**, can lead to flawed decisions. It‚Äôs most effective when paired with a well-defined trading strategy and a realistic understanding of price behavior.

üß† Things to Remember
--------------------

* The R/R ratio is about **planning**, not predicting.
* A good ratio doesn‚Äôt mean a good trade ‚Äî it must be part of a larger system with sound **entry criteria** and **risk controls**.
* You can be profitable with a **low win rate** if your reward is large enough compared to your risk.
* **Sticking to your R/R discipline** over time can improve your consistency and help preserve capital ‚Äî which is the name of the game.
