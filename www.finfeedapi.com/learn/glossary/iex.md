### IEX

IEX stands for the Investors Exchange ‚Äî a U.S. stock exchange launched in 2016 with the mission to level the playing field between Wall Street and Main Street. Unlike traditional exchanges, IEX was created to protect long-term investors from predatory high-frequency trading (HFT) tactics by introducing unique features that prioritize fairness and transparency.

IEX gained national attention from the book *Flash Boys* by Michael Lewis, which exposed how some market structures favored speed and insider advantages. IEX emerged as a **reformer**, offering an alternative approach to stock trading.

üéØ Mission and Vision
--------------------

IEX‚Äôs core mission is to create a **fairer, more transparent exchange** ‚Äî one where investors and institutions aren‚Äôt disadvantaged by speed-based trading games. It aims to **build trust in public markets** by eliminating structural unfairness and creating a **more investor-friendly environment**.

Its slogan ‚Äî *‚ÄúBuilt for investors, not speed‚Äù* ‚Äî highlights its focus on **market integrity** over milliseconds of speed advantage.

üõ†Ô∏è What Makes IEX Unique?
-------------------------

The defining feature of IEX is the **Speed Bump** ‚Äî a **38-microsecond delay** that slows down incoming orders. This minor delay prevents high-frequency traders from jumping ahead of large institutional orders by exploiting faster data feeds.

Other key features include:

* **No co-location**: Traders can‚Äôt install servers next to the exchange to gain an advantage.
* **Simplified order types**: Reduces complexity and reduces opportunities for manipulation.
* **Focus on transparency**: Execution quality and pricing rules are designed to benefit investors, not intermediaries.

üìä Who Uses IEX?
---------------

IEX is popular among **long-term institutional investors**, such as mutual funds, pension funds, and endowments. These investors value the protection IEX offers against front-running and price manipulation.

While IEX handles a **smaller share of U.S. trading volume** compared to giants like NYSE or NASDAQ, it has earned a reputation for **trustworthiness and innovation** in market structure.

IEX prioritizes **market quality over volume**, making it fundamentally different from more traditional exchanges.

üîç Regulatory and Market Role
----------------------------

IEX became a fully registered **national securities exchange** in 2016, regulated by the **U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ([SEC](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/sec))**. While it originally started as an [alternative trading system](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/ats) (ATS), its elevation to exchange status marked a significant step in promoting **competition and reform** in U.S. markets.

üß† Things to Remember
--------------------

* IEX is a **mission-driven exchange** that promotes **fairness over speed**.
* It introduced the **speed bump** to reduce HFT advantages and protect investors.
* While smaller in size, it plays a **meaningful role in shaping market structure reform**.
* IEX reminds us that in modern markets, **transparency and trust are just as important as liquidity and speed**.
