### Cross-exchange arbitrage

Cross-exchange arbitrage is a trading strategy that involves buying an asset on one exchange where it‚Äôs priced lower and simultaneously selling it on another exchange where it‚Äôs priced higher, profiting from the price difference.

This practice exploits **inefficiencies in pricing** between different marketplaces ‚Äî often due to differences in liquidity, trading volume, speed, or regional market conditions. While often associated with **cryptocurrencies**, it also exists in **stocks, ETFs, commodities**, and even **foreign exchange markets**.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
---------------

The basic idea is simple:

1. **Monitor multiple exchanges** for the same asset.
2. Identify a **price gap** between two platforms.
3. **Buy low on Exchange A**, and **sell high on Exchange B**.
4. Pocket the difference ‚Äî minus fees, slippage, and transfer costs.

For example:

* Stock ABC is trading at **$100 on Exchange A**.
* At the same moment, it‚Äôs priced at **$101 on Exchange B**.
* If you buy 100 shares on A and sell them on B, you capture a **$1 per share profit**, or **$100 total** ‚Äî before costs.

This strategy typically requires **high speed, automation**, and **real-time data**, especially in fast-moving markets where opportunities can vanish in seconds.

üß† Key Factors for Success
-------------------------

* **Speed of execution**: Arbitrage windows are often short-lived ‚Äî milliseconds matter.
* **Low latency access**: Faster data and order routing improves edge.
* **Access to capital**: You need funds available on both exchanges to act quickly.
* **Transaction costs**: Fees, spreads, and withdrawal delays can eat into or eliminate profits.
* **Market conditions**: Illiquid or fragmented markets tend to create more opportunities.

üíπ Where It‚Äôs Commonly Used
--------------------------

* **Cryptocurrency**: Price differences between exchanges (e.g., Binance vs. Coinbase) can be significant due to lack of centralized pricing.
* **Global stock listings**: Dual-listed companies (e.g., Royal Dutch Shell on London and Amsterdam exchanges) may diverge temporarily in price.
* **ETFs**: Exchange-traded funds tracking the same index might trade at slightly different prices on different platforms.
* **Forex markets**: Currency pairs priced differently across brokers or regions can be arbitraged ‚Äî often by large institutions.

‚öñÔ∏è Risks and Limitations
------------------------

* **Execution risk**: One leg of the trade might fail, leaving you exposed to price movements.
* **Transfer delays**: Moving funds or assets between exchanges can take time ‚Äî during which prices can change.
* **Fees and commissions**: These can turn a profitable spread into a loss if not accounted for.
* **Slippage**: Market conditions might shift before your trade executes.
* **Regulatory friction**: Some exchanges or jurisdictions may restrict arbitrage activity or fund transfers.

üß† Things to Remember
--------------------

* Cross-exchange arbitrage is about exploiting **temporary pricing inefficiencies** ‚Äî not long-term investments.
* Profits per trade are usually small but can add up with **volume and speed**.
* Requires **real-time data, automation**, and careful cost management.
* Best suited for **high-frequency traders or algorithmic strategies** ‚Äî though manual arbitrage still occurs in crypto and niche markets.
* Like all strategies, it‚Äôs only effective when properly executed ‚Äî **small errors can turn a small edge into a fast loss**.
