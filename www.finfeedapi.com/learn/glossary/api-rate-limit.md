### API Rate Limit

An API rate limit is the maximum number of requests a client can make to an API within a specific time period. It's essentially a cap on how frequently you can interact with an API service.

**API Rate Limit - Definition**
-------------------------------

A **Rate Limit** for an API specifies the highest number of requests that a client is permitted to send to an **Application Programming Interface (API)** during a defined time period. This control is vital for preserving the reliability, efficiency, and protection of APIs by stopping excessive use that might cause service impairment or interruptions.

**What is API Rate Limiting?**
------------------------------

**API rate limiting** is a technique implemented to regulate the volume of incoming and outgoing traffic to or from a network. By establishing a cap on the number of API calls a user or application can perform within a particular timeframe, rate limiting guarantees that the API stays accessible and quick to respond for all valid users.

**Without rate limiting, APIs risk being flooded with too many requests**, which can reduce performance or result in service failures.

One widely used approach to API rate limiting is **throttling.** It temporarily constrains the frequency of incoming requests by either reducing response speeds or completely rejecting them once the threshold is reached. Throttling can be implemented at various levels, such as across the entire API, per individual user, or application.

**Why is API Rate Limiting Necessary?**
---------------------------------------

API rate limiting fulfills several essential purposes:

* **Security:** Defends APIs against harmful attacks, including Denial-of-Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, which attempt to overwhelm the API with excessive requests.
* **Resource Management:** Facilitates fair resource allocation among all users by stopping any single user or automated program from dominating API resources.
* **Cost Efficiency:** Assists in managing operational expenses by restricting the number of requests that utilize backend resources. This prevents unexpected increases in usage that could result in higher costs.
* **Quality of Service:** Sustains optimal API performance and dependability, ensuring that legitimate users experience steady and rapid responses.

**Things to Remember**
----------------------

* **Essential for API Stability:** API rate limiting is fundamental for maintaining the stability and reliability of APIs by managing the number of requests within a designated timeframe.
* **Protects Against Attacks:** Establishing rate limits helps shield APIs from malicious activities such as DoS and DDoS attacks, ensuring consistent security.
* **Optimizes Resource Usage:** By controlling the flow of requests, rate limiting ensures equitable resource distribution and prevents any individual user or application from monopolizing API resources.
* **Supports Cost Management and Performance:** Effective rate limiting helps control operational costs and maintain high performance, delivering better service quality for all legitimate users.
