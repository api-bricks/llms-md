Corporate Actions - Definition
------------------------------

**Corporate actions** are events initiated by a publicly traded company that bring a change—either financial, structural, or procedural, to the securities it has issued. These actions can significantly impact shareholders and the overall market perception of the company.

### Types of Corporate Actions

#### Mandatory Corporate Actions

**Mandatory corporate actions** are initiated by the company and automatically apply to all shareholders without requiring any action from them. Examples include:

* **Stock splits:** Increase the number of outstanding shares to reduce the share price.
* **[Dividends](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/dividends):** Distribution of a portion of the company's earnings to shareholders, either in cash or additional shares.
* **Mergers and acquisitions:** Combining with or being acquired by another company.
* **Spinoffs:** Creating a new independent company from a part of the existing business.

#### Voluntary Corporate Actions

**Voluntary corporate actions** require shareholders to choose their participation. These actions are optional and depend on the decision of the individual investor. Common examples include:

* **Rights issues:** Offering existing shareholders the right to purchase additional shares at a discounted price.
* **Tender offers:** A company proposes to buy back shares from shareholders at a specific price.
* **Exchange offers:** Shareholders can exchange one type of security for another.

#### Mandatory with Choice

These corporate actions require shareholders to make a decision, but a default option is applied if no action is taken. An example is:

* **Dividend options:** Shareholders may choose between receiving cash dividends or additional shares.

### Examples of Corporate Actions

#### Stock Splits

A **stock split** increases the number of a company's outstanding shares, reducing the price per share. For instance, in a two-for-one split, an investor holding one share would receive an additional share, each valued at half the original price. While the total equity remains unchanged, stock splits can make shares more accessible to investors and potentially boost stock prices over time.

#### Reverse Stock Splits

In contrast to a stock split, a **reverse stock split** consolidates the number of shares, increasing the price per share. For example, a 10-for-1 reverse split would convert 10 shares at $1 each into one share at $10. This is often used to elevate a stock's price to avoid being labeled a penny stock or to attract institutional investors.

#### Dividends

[**Dividends**](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/dividends) are distributions of a company's profits to its shareholders and can be paid in cash or additional shares. **Cash dividends** provide immediate income to shareholders, indicating strong financial health. **Stock dividends** increase the number of shares owned, which can dilute earnings per share but may signal future growth.

#### Rights Issues

A **rights issue** offers existing shareholders the opportunity to purchase additional shares before they are made available to the public. This is often a way for companies to raise capital while providing current investors with a preferential option, signaling confidence in future developments.

#### Mergers and Acquisitions

* **Mergers:** When two companies combine, with one surrendering its stock to the other. This can be seen as a strategic expansion or industry consolidation.
* **Acquisitions:** One company purchases a majority stake in another, which can be friendly or hostile.
* **Reverse mergers:** A private company acquires a public one to become publicly traded without an initial public offering.

#### Contingent Value Rights (CVRs)

**Contingent Value Rights (CVRs)** provide shareholders with compensation if specific events occur within a set timeframe, often used during acquisitions to bridge valuation gaps. Compensation can be in cash or additional shares, depending on performance targets.

#### Spinoffs

A **spinoff** involves a company creating a new independent entity by divesting part of its assets or issuing new shares. This can indicate a strategic focus on core business areas or preparation for new growth ventures.

#### Name/Symbol Changes

Companies may change their name or [ticker](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/ticker) symbol to reflect a shift in business focus, rebrand, or distance themselves from past events. For example, Facebook rebranded to Meta in 2022 to signify its expansion beyond social media.

#### Liquidation

When a company can no longer meet its financial obligations, it may enter **liquidation**, selling off assets to pay creditors. This typically results in shares becoming worthless, as shareholders are last in the priority list for asset distribution.

### Impact of Corporate Actions

#### On Shareholders

Corporate actions can directly affect shareholders by altering the value and number of their shares, changing ownership structures, and influencing voting rights. **Understanding these impacts** is crucial for making informed investment decisions.

#### On Taxation

Different corporate actions have varying tax implications. For example, cash dividends are usually taxable as income, while stock dividends may affect the cost basis of shares. Mergers and spinoffs can also trigger capital gains taxes.

#### On Retail vs. Institutional Investors

While both types of investors are affected by corporate actions, the impact can differ. Institutional investors may have more influence over decisions and access to detailed analyses, whereas retail investors might experience dilution or concentration of their holdings differently.

### Importance of Corporate Actions

**Corporate actions** are significant as they can influence stock prices, ownership and voting rights, tax obligations, and investment strategies. They provide insights into a company's financial health and strategic direction, making them essential for accurate valuation and analysis.

### Monitoring Corporate Actions

Investors, traders, and financial analysts closely monitor corporate actions to identify opportunities or risks. Data providers and APIs track these events to adjust historical price data and inform investment strategies effectively.
