### Junk bond

A junk bond is a type of corporate bond that offers high returns ‚Äî but with high risk. Like all bonds, it represents a loan made by an investor to a company. In return, the company agrees to pay regular interest and repay the principal at the end of the bond‚Äôs term.

What makes a junk bond different is **who‚Äôs borrowing the money**. Junk bonds are issued by companies that **do not have strong credit ratings**, meaning they are considered **less financially stable** or have higher debt levels. Because these companies are more likely to default ‚Äî that is, fail to make interest payments or repay the debt ‚Äî investors demand **higher yields** to compensate for the extra risk.

üîç Credit Ratings and What They Mean
-----------------------------------

To help investors understand risk, credit rating agencies such as **Moody‚Äôs**, **Standard & Poor‚Äôs (S&P)**, and **Fitch** assign grades to bonds. Bonds rated **BBB- or above (S&P/Fitch)** or **Baa3 or above (Moody‚Äôs)** are considered **investment grade**, meaning they‚Äôre relatively safe.

Bonds rated **below those thresholds** fall into the **non-investment grade** category, commonly known as **junk bonds** or **high-yield bonds**.

* Example of investment grade: **Apple** bonds (AA+ rating) ‚Äî very safe, lower yield.
* Example of junk bond: **AMC Theatres bonds (2020)** ‚Äî higher risk, much higher yield.

üí∞ Why Would Anyone Buy a Junk Bond?
-----------------------------------

Despite the name, junk bonds are a legitimate investment ‚Äî just with more risk attached. Investors often buy them for the **potentially higher returns**. In a low-interest-rate environment, for example, junk bonds can provide income that‚Äôs hard to find elsewhere.

They can also play a role in a **diversified portfolio**. Some investors are willing to accept a bit more risk for a slice of higher income, especially if they believe a company will turn around or survive tough conditions.

‚ö†Ô∏è The Risks Involved
---------------------

The major risk is **default**. If the issuing company runs into trouble, it might miss payments or even go bankrupt. Junk bonds are also more volatile ‚Äî their prices can swing dramatically based on market sentiment or news about the issuing company.

Junk bonds tend to do better when the **economy is strong**, and worse during downturns. That‚Äôs because weaker companies are more vulnerable when business slows.

üìà Real-World Examples
---------------------

* **Tesla (2017)**: Before it was profitable, Tesla issued junk bonds to fund the Model 3 ramp-up. Investors were attracted to the brand and growth story, even though Tesla was burning cash at the time. The bond offered a yield of about 5.3%.
* **Sprint (pre-merger)**: Struggled with massive debt and competition in the telecom space. Its bonds were rated as junk for years due to concerns about profitability and survival.
* **AMC Theatres (2020‚Äì2021)**: Hit hard by the pandemic, AMC issued junk bonds to raise emergency cash. Investors took the risk, betting that the company would survive ‚Äî and some were rewarded handsomely as AMC's stock and bonds rebounded.

üß† The Bottom Line
-----------------

Junk bonds aren‚Äôt for everyone, but they‚Äôre not inherently bad ‚Äî just riskier. They can offer high income, but come with a real chance of losing money if the issuer defaults. If you‚Äôre considering investing in them, it‚Äôs crucial to understand the financial health of the company and to assess whether the potential rewards outweigh the risks.

They‚Äôre a classic case of **"higher risk, higher reward"**, and should be approached with careful research and caution ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre not a seasoned investor.
