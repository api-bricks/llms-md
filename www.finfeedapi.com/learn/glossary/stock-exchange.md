### Stock exchange

A stock exchange is a regulated marketplace where buyers and sellers come together to trade financial securities ‚Äî most commonly stocks, but also bonds, ETFs, and derivatives. It acts as the central hub for public trading, ensuring that transactions are executed in a fair, transparent, and orderly way.

üß≠ How Does a Stock Exchange Work?
---------------------------------

Companies list their shares on a stock exchange through an **initial public offering (IPO)**. Once listed, the company‚Äôs stock is **available to the public**, and its price is determined by **supply and demand** in the marketplace.

When you place a trade to buy or sell a stock, the exchange:

* **Matches your order** with someone on the other side (a buyer or seller),
* Executes the transaction at the **market price** (or your limit price),
* And **records the trade** for regulatory and reporting purposes.

Exchanges are powered by **electronic systems**, with some (like NYSE) still maintaining a **physical trading floor**, while others (like NASDAQ) are fully digital.

üåç Major Stock Exchanges Around the World
----------------------------------------

* **New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)** ‚Äì The largest exchange by market capitalization, home to blue-chip U.S. companies.
* **NASDAQ** ‚Äì A fully electronic exchange known for its tech-heavy listings.
* **London Stock Exchange (LSE)** ‚Äì A major European exchange with global reach.
* **Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE)** ‚Äì Asia‚Äôs largest exchange.
* **Shanghai and Hong Kong Exchanges** ‚Äì Key players in Chinese and international finance.
* **Euronext, Deutsche B√∂rse, and others** ‚Äì Serving various regions in Europe.

üìà What Gets Traded on a Stock Exchange?
---------------------------------------

While **common stocks** are the main attraction, exchanges also host trading in:

* **Preferred shares**
* **Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)**
* **Corporate and government bonds**
* **Options and futures** (on specialized exchanges or affiliated platforms)

All these assets are considered **securities**, and the exchange provides the **infrastructure** for orderly price discovery and trade execution.

üß† Why Stock Exchanges Matter
----------------------------

Stock exchanges serve **three essential roles** in the financial system:

1. **Liquidity**: They make it easy to buy and sell assets quickly and efficiently.
2. **Price discovery**: They provide a real-time view of what assets are worth based on investor demand.
3. **Access to capital**: They allow companies to raise money from the public by issuing shares.

For investors, stock exchanges offer a **trusted environment** to invest, trade, and build wealth. For companies, they provide **visibility, credibility**, and the capital needed to grow.

üß† Things to Remember
--------------------

* A stock exchange is where **public securities are listed, traded, and regulated**.
* It connects **companies with investors** and **buyers with sellers**, ensuring transparent and efficient transactions.
* Exchanges are overseen by regulatory bodies (like the [SEC](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/sec) in the U.S.) to maintain **fairness and integrity**.
* Not all trades happen on exchanges ‚Äî some occur **‚Äúoff-exchange‚Äù** via alternative trading systems or dark pools ‚Äî but exchanges remain the **core platform for price transparency**.
