What's Euronext DS?
-------------------

**Euronext DS** refers to the **Deferred Settlement Service** (French: *Service de Règlement Différé*, SRD) offered by Euronext Paris. This service allows investors to buy or sell eligible securities on margin. It defers the settlement of the transaction until the end of the month. **Euronext DS** provides leverage and flexibility to traders. It is particularly useful for those engaging in short-term strategies.

### How It Works

When using the Deferred Settlement Service, investors can execute trades without immediate payment or delivery of the securities. **Settlement is postponed to the last trading day of the month.** The transfer of funds and securities occurs on that later date.

Additionally, investors can defer settlement to the next month. This option is available a few days before the scheduled settlement. An additional fee or margin is required to defer further.

### Eligibility and Conditions

**Eligible Securities:** Not all securities qualify for deferred settlement. Euronext Paris maintains a list of eligible securities. The criteria include market capitalization and liquidity.

**Margin Requirements:** The service involves leverage. Investors must maintain a margin account. The margin serves as collateral to cover potential losses.

**[Dividends](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/dividends) and [Corporate Actions](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/corporate-actions):** For trades under deferred settlement, dividends are credited or debited to the investor's account. This depends on the trade's timing relative to the dividend payment date. Corporate actions are handled to accommodate the deferred settlement.

### Advantages

* **Leverage:** Investors can take larger positions than their immediate capital allows. This can potentially enhance returns.
* **Flexibility:** Deferring settlement provides strategic flexibility, especially in volatile markets.
* **Short Selling:** The service allows short selling. Investors can sell securities they do not own. They aim to buy them back at a lower price.

### Risks

* **Market Risk:** Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. Adverse market movements can lead to significant losses.
* **Margin Calls:** If the position's value declines, investors may need to deposit additional funds. This maintains the margin.
* **Interest and Fees:** Deferring settlement incurs additional costs. These can accumulate over time.

### Practical Applications

**Euronext DS** benefits traders using short-term strategies. Examples include day trading or swing trading. The flexibility to defer settlements enhances trading efficiency and strategy execution.

It also supports trading techniques like leveraging positions and short selling. This caters to both individual and institutional investors seeking advanced trading capabilities.
