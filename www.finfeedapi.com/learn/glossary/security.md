### Security

In finance, a security is a tradable financial asset that holds value and can be bought, sold, or held as part of an investment portfolio. Securities are the building blocks of markets ‚Äî they represent ownership (like stocks), debt (like bonds), or rights to future earnings or cash flow (like options or derivatives). If you‚Äôre trading or investing, you‚Äôre almost always dealing with some form of security.

üîç Types of Securities
---------------------

Securities come in a few main categories, each serving different purposes:

### üìà **Equity Securities**

These represent **ownership in a company**. The most common example is **stock** (or shares), which gives the holder a claim on part of the company‚Äôs assets and profits. Some stocks also pay [**dividends**](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/dividends), and holders may have **voting rights** in shareholder decisions.

### üíµ **Debt Securities**

These represent a **loan made by the investor to the issuer**, typically in the form of **bonds**. The issuer (like a corporation or government) agrees to pay back the principal with interest over time. Debt securities are generally considered **lower risk and lower return** compared to stocks.

### üîÄ **Derivatives**

These are contracts whose value is **derived from another asset** (the ‚Äúunderlying‚Äù), such as a stock, index, or commodity. Common derivatives include **options, futures, and swaps**. They are often used for **hedging or speculation** and can carry high risk.

üß† Why Securities Matter
-----------------------

Securities are the tools investors use to **participate in the financial markets** ‚Äî to build wealth, manage risk, and support businesses. For companies and governments, issuing securities is a way to **raise capital** to fund growth, operations, or infrastructure.

Markets would not function without securities. They are the **connective tissue between investors, institutions, and issuers**, enabling the global flow of capital.

üõ°Ô∏è Regulation of Securities
---------------------------

In the U.S., securities are regulated by the **Securities and Exchange Commission ([SEC](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/sec))**. The SEC ensures that companies **disclose accurate financial information**, and that trading is **fair, transparent, and free of manipulation**.

To be legally offered to the public, most securities must be **registered** with the SEC, unless they qualify for an exemption (such as private placements).

üß† Things to Remember
--------------------

* A **security** is any financial asset that can be bought, sold, or traded ‚Äî including **stocks, bonds, options, ETFs**, and more.
* Securities fall into broad categories: **equity (ownership)**, **debt (lending)**, and **derivatives (contracts)**.
* They are essential for both **investors seeking returns** and **companies seeking funding**.
* Not all investments are securities ‚Äî for example, **real estate or collectibles** are not, unless tokenized or bundled into tradable forms.
* Securities are **regulated** to protect investors and promote market confidence.

Securities are the **core instruments** of modern investing ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre building a retirement portfolio or trading options on your lunch break, you‚Äôre working with them every step of the way.
