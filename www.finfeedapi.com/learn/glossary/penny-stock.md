Penny Stock - Definition
------------------------

**A penny stock is generally defined as a common share of a small public company that trades at a low price per share.** Typically, the price is under five dollars per share. These stocks are often traded over-the-counter (OTC) instead of on major stock exchanges. This provides access to investors interested in emerging or specialized markets. Penny stocks are attractive because their low price allows purchasing large quantities with minimal capital. However, they come with higher volatility and risk. They are best suited for experienced investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities.

Trading Platforms
-----------------

**Penny stocks are primarily traded on over-the-counter (OTC) exchanges.** Examples include the OTC Bulletin Board and OTC Link LLC. These platforms offer a marketplace for securities not listed on major stock exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. Some penny stocks may also be listed on foreign exchanges or traded by private companies without active markets. The OTC nature of penny stocks results in lower liquidity and greater potential for price manipulation.

Risk and Investment
-------------------

**Investing in penny stocks involves significant risk.** Their low market capitalization and small market size contribute to this risk. Market capitalization is the total value of a company's outstanding shares. Penny stocks' low price allows buying large quantities without much financial commitment.

However, this often leads to increased market volatility. Volatility measures return dispersion for a security. Higher volatility means greater risk. Penny stocks can experience rapid price changes, resulting in substantial gains or losses quickly.

Fraud and Scams
---------------

**The penny stock market is known for fraudulent activities.** One common scam is the "pump and dump" scheme. Fraudsters artificially inflate a penny stock's price using false or misleading information. This entices investors to buy shares. Once the price peaks, manipulators sell their holdings for a profit. The stock price then drops, causing significant losses for investors. Low liquidity of penny stocks makes it hard to exit positions. Regulatory bodies like the SEC and FBI actively pursue and prosecute such fraudulent activities.

Regulatory Framework
--------------------

**In the United States, penny stocks are regulated by the SEC and FINRA.** The SEC defines a penny stock as a security from a small public company trading below five dollars per share, not listed on major exchanges. Regulations include requirements for minimum shareholder equity and disclosures to prevent fraud and manipulation. State securities laws are also important. Georgia was the first state to enforce comprehensive penny stock regulations. These combined regulations aim to enhance transparency and reduce fraudulent schemes in the penny stock market.

Notable Cases
-------------

**The penny stock market has seen significant fraudulent activities historically.** In the 1980s and 1990s, figures like Lorenzo Formato and Louis Malpeso Jr. engaged in pump-and-dump schemes. They manipulated stock prices for illicit gains. The collapse of firms like Blinder, Robinson & Company highlighted risks with penny stock brokerages. High-profile cases, including FBI operations against fraud, led to stricter regulations and reforms. The Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 resulted from these cases. These events underline the importance of regulatory oversight and investor vigilance.

Practical Applications
----------------------

**Despite the risks, penny stocks offer practical opportunities for investors.** They provide access to high-growth potential in new or specialized industries. Investors can participate in the early stages of companies that might become leaders. Academic research suggests penny stocks' risks can lead to higher expected returns, compensating for size and liquidity premiums. Investors can include penny stocks in diversified portfolios to balance potential high rewards with more stable investments. However, conducting due diligence and adopting cautious investment strategies is essential to mitigate risks.
