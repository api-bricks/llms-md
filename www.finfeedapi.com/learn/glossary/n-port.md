N-PORT - Definition
-------------------

**Form N-PORT** is a regulatory filing mandated by the **U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ([SEC](https://www.finfeedapi.com/learn/glossary/sec))** for certain registered investment companies. It requires these funds to report detailed information about their portfolio holdings and risk metrics monthly.

This form is integral to the SEC's efforts to enhance transparency and oversight within the investment management industry. It ensures that investors have access to comprehensive and up-to-date information about their investments.

Purpose and Scope
-----------------

The primary purpose of Form N-PORT is to provide the SEC with timely and standardized data on fund portfolios. This process facilitates better monitoring of risks and market trends.

The form collects extensive information, including portfolio holdings, exposure to derivatives, liquidity classifications of investments, securities lending activities, and risk metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR). By aggregating this data, the SEC can assess potential risks within the investment fund industry. This enables informed regulatory decisions, safeguarding investor interests and maintaining market stability.

Filing Requirements
-------------------

Registered investment companies, excluding money market funds and certain unit investment trusts, must file Form N-PORT electronically in XML format through the SEC's EDGAR system. These funds must maintain records of the required information within 30 days after the end of each month.

This monthly reporting obligation ensures that the SEC receives continuous and up-to-date insights into fund operations and risk exposures. It enables proactive regulatory oversight.

Recent Developments
-------------------

In August 2024, the SEC adopted significant amendments to Form N-PORT to enhance data quality and timeliness. These changes include improved reporting on liquidity risk management, additional disclosures regarding service providers, and adjustments to the frequency and scope of certain data elements.

The amendments aim to provide the SEC and investors with more comprehensive and up-to-date information about fund operations and risks. This increases the effectiveness of regulatory oversight and improves investor confidence.

Data Sets and Access
--------------------

Form N-PORT data sets are updated quarterly. They include publicly available information from filings disseminated by the SEC. Funds report information about their portfolios and each portfolio holding as of the last business day or last calendar day of each month.

The data sets are accessible through the SEC's official page. They provide valuable resources for investors, analysts, and regulators to analyze fund data comprehensively. Detailed documentation is available in the Form N-PORT readme PDF.

Practical Applications
----------------------

Understanding Form N-PORT is crucial for investment professionals, compliance officers, and investors. It helps assess the transparency and risk management practices of registered investment funds.

By analyzing detailed portfolio holdings and risk metrics reported on Form N-PORT, stakeholders can make informed decisions about fund selection, risk exposure, and regulatory compliance. Additionally, the enhanced data from recent SEC amendments supports more robust investment strategies and regulatory frameworks.
