### 2. How do I set up AWS VPC peering with CoinAPI?[​](/general/faq/Enterprise-Plan/#2-how-do-i-set-up-aws-vpc-peering-with-coinapi "Direct link to 2. How do I set up AWS VPC peering with CoinAPI?")

CoinAPI supports AWS VPC peering for customers on Enterprise Plans. This setup provides ultra-low latency, private connectivity between your AWS infrastructure and CoinAPI's systems.

Steps to set up AWS VPC peering:

1. Open a Support Case

   Submit a support request with your AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`) and intended VPC setup.
2. Receive Setup Details

   Our support team will send the required details for initiating the peering request from your AWS Console.
3. Create the Peering Request

   In your AWS account, navigate to:

   [VPC Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpcconsole/home#PeeringConnections) > Create Peering Connection
4. Connection Approval

   CoinAPI will accept your peering request from our side.
5. Customer Confirmation

   After acceptance, you should verify the connectivity. Confirm that routing and communication work as expected.

This setup enables private, high-throughput access to CoinAPI endpoints with reduced latency and improved reliability—ideal for enterprise-grade applications.
