How does CoinAPI’s credit system work? Do I need to preload credits, and how fast are charges reflected?
========================================================================================================

Yes, to use credit-based services like **Flat Files** or **REST API** access, you must **preload usage credits** to your account. Here's how it works:

Preloading Credits

* Once you link your credit card, you’ll need to **manually add credits** through the **Billing** > **Add Usage Credits** section in the Customer Portal.
* Optionally, you can enable **Auto Recharge**, which automatically tops up your credits once your balance falls below a defined threshold.

How Charges Work

* Credits are **prepaid**, meaning you load your account before downloading data.
* The cost of your activity (e.g., API calls, Flat File access) is deducted from your **available credit balance**.

Processing Time

* Credit top-ups are processed **in near real-time**. (Delays may still occur. You may reach out to Support to verify the status)
* Your available balance updates almost immediately after the credit card is charged.
* Only exception: **crypto payments** may have a short delay (up to 1 hour) due to blockchain confirmation times.
