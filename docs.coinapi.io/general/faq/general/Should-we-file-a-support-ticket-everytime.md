Should we file a support ticket every time we experience a problem?
===================================================================

Yes, your company should file a support ticket whenever an issue occurs. This is essential even if the problem seems temporary or intermittent.

Here’s why:

* Your support SLA (if applicable) is only activated when a ticket is submitted.
* Without a formal ticket, we cannot guarantee prioritization, investigation, or tracking of the issue.
* If your plan does not include a service-level SLA, we do not monitor or proactively respond to issues unless they are reported.

For customers with custom SLAs, we track specific metrics and build infrastructure to meet those guarantees. For all other users, we rely on incoming tickets to understand what matters to your business.

Our process:

* We continuously monitor infrastructure and act on system-level issues.
* However, without ticket input, we may not detect or be accountable for individual cases that affect your workflow.
* If needed, we expand monitoring and internal metrics based on patterns in submitted tickets.

To submit a ticket, use:
