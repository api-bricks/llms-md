I didn’t receive an email from CoinAPI. What should I do?
=========================================================

If you're expecting an email from CoinAPI (e.g., log in email, notifications) and haven't received it, please follow this checklist before submitting a support request:

1. Refresh your inbox and wait at least 2 minutes in case of provider-side email latency
2. Check your spam or junk folder
3. If you're using a Google Groups alias, verify whether the message was held for moderation
4. Try resending the request (for log in emails)
5. Try using a different email address to determine if the issue is isolated to your current provider

If none of these steps resolve the issue, please submit a request through our support portal:

<https://support.coinapi.io/hc/en-us/requests/new>
