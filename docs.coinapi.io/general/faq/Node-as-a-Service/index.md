Frequently Asked Questions[​](/general/faq/Node-as-a-Service/#frequently-asked-questions "Direct link to Frequently Asked Questions")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. How does CoinAPI's Node-as-a-Service (NaaS) work?[​](/general/faq/Node-as-a-Service/#1-how-does-coinapis-node-as-a-service-naas-work "Direct link to 1. How does CoinAPI's Node-as-a-Service (NaaS) work?")

CoinAPI’s Node-as-a-Service (NaaS) offers public blockchain nodes for networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, accessible via HTTP API endpoints. This service allows developers to interact with blockchain data and send transactions without the complexity of running and maintaining their own full nodes.

**Key benefits:**

* **Reliable Access**: Connect to popular blockchains through high-availability infrastructure.
* **Scalable API**: Use HTTP endpoints to query blockchain state, broadcast transactions, and fetch block or transaction details.
* **No Infrastructure Overhead**: Eliminate the need to deploy, monitor, or scale your own nodes.

This is ideal for wallets, explorers, analytics tools, and any service needing on-demand blockchain connectivity.

### 2. How do I get started with CoinAPI's NaaS?[​](/general/faq/Node-as-a-Service/#2-how-do-i-get-started-with-coinapis-naas "Direct link to 2. How do I get started with CoinAPI's NaaS?")

To begin using CoinAPI's NaaS:

1. Obtain an API Key: Sign up on the CoinAPI website to receive your API key
2. Access Node Endpoints: Use the provided HTTP API endpoints to connect to the desired blockchain nodes
3. Integrate into Your Application: Utilize the API endpoints to interact with blockchain data within your application

### 3. What are the benefits of using CoinAPI's NaaS over self-hosted nodes?[​](/general/faq/Node-as-a-Service/#3-what-are-the-benefits-of-using-coinapis-naas-over-self-hosted-nodes "Direct link to 3. What are the benefits of using CoinAPI's NaaS over self-hosted nodes?")

Opting for CoinAPI's NaaS offers several advantages over self-hosting nodes:

* Simplified Setup: Eliminates the need for complex node configuration and maintenance
* Cost-Effective: Reduces expenses associated with hardware, storage, and bandwidth
* Scalability: Easily accommodates increased demand without the need for additional infrastructure
* Reliability: Ensures consistent uptime and performance through managed services

In contrast, self-hosted nodes require significant resources, ongoing maintenance, and technical expertise to manage effectively.

### 4. What security measures are in place for CoinAPI's NaaS?[​](/general/faq/Node-as-a-Service/#4-what-security-measures-are-in-place-for-coinapis-naas "Direct link to 4. What security measures are in place for CoinAPI's NaaS?")

CoinAPI prioritizes security by:

* Authentication: Utilizing API keys and optional JWT tokens to secure access
* Data Encryption: Recommending HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for encrypted data transmission between your application and CoinAPI's servers
* Best Practices: Advising users to keep API keys confidential and monitor for updates to ensure compatibility and security

### 5. What types of nodes does CoinAPI offer?[​](/general/faq/Node-as-a-Service/#5-what-types-of-nodes-does-coinapi-offer "Direct link to 5. What types of nodes does CoinAPI offer?")

CoinAPI offers various node configurations to suit different project needs:

* Shared Nodes: Multiple users share the same node resources, offering a cost-effective solution for projects with moderate demands
* Semi-Shared Nodes: Fewer users share the node, providing a balance between cost and performance
* Dedicated Nodes: Exclusive access to a node, ensuring maximum performance and control, ideal for high-demand applications

Choosing the right node type depends on factors like project scale, performance requirements, and budget.

### 6. Does CoinAPI provide data for blockchain verification, deposit/withdrawal status, or token contract addresses?[​](/general/faq/Node-as-a-Service/#6-does-coinapi-provide-data-for-blockchain-verification-depositwithdrawal-status-or-token-contract-addresses "Direct link to 6. Does CoinAPI provide data for blockchain verification, deposit/withdrawal status, or token contract addresses?")

CoinAPI primarily provides market data — such as `ask_price`, `bid_price`, `volume`, and symbol metadata — but also offers extended blockchain insights through the Node as a Service (NaaS) platform.

Here’s how your use cases are supported:

1. Verifying Blockchain and Token Details

* The `/v1/assets` endpoint in the Market Data API provides metadata such as `chain_id`, `network_id`, and blockchain asset identifiers.
* For more advanced token-level verification (e.g., contract inspection), CoinAPI's Node as a Service supports blockchain queries, especially for Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains.

2. Deposit and Withdrawal Availability

* CoinAPI does not currently provide real-time availability of deposits/withdrawals for assets on exchanges.
* This status usually requires direct API access or scraping of each exchange’s operational notices.

3. Deposit/Withdraw Address Validation

* Not available directly via CoinAPI.
* However, NaaS Ethereum methods can retrieve blockchain transaction data, which can assist in indirectly verifying address activity and correctness.

4. Token Contract Address Verification

* Use `/v1/assets` for active asset metadata.
* Use `/v1/symbols` to map tokens to specific exchanges, with `symbol_id_exchange` and related metadata.
