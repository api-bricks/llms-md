What do I need to complete a subscription payment?
==================================================

Purchasing a subscription is straightforward. Here’s what you need to do:

Steps to Complete Payment:

1. Log in to your company's main account on the CoinAPI Customer Portal (<https://console.coinapi.io/>)
2. After logging in, visit the pricing page to choose your desired subscription: <https://www.coinapi.io/products/market-data-api/pricing>
3. After choosing the subscription, you'll be redirected to a secure Stripe checkout page.
4. Enter your credit card details and, if applicable, your VAT ID.
5. Once the payment is completed, your subscription will be activated and you'll receive an invoice.

Important Notes:

* Please complete your company information in the Billing section *before purchasing*. This info is used to generate your invoice.
* VAT ID is required only for companies in the EU, except for the UK and Switzerland.
