How to upgrade/downgrade my subscription?
=========================================

You may upgrade/downgrade your subscription via the Customer Portal (<https://console.coinapi.io/>). After logging in, please navigate to Subscriptions > Update Subscription > Select the appropriate subscription that you want to switch to > Continue. We can upgrade or downgrade your subscription as well via a support request.

Upgrading and downgrading operations are prorated; the remaining amount on your subscription at the moment of the change will be credited towards future liabilities. Your billing period cycle is not affected by the plan change.

Example 1:

If you have a Streamer subscription with a billing date of 2018-07-15 and it's 2018-07-05 and you want to upgrade your Streamer plan to the Professional, then:

* Unused Streamer subscriptions between 2018-07-05 and 2018-07-15 will be credited
* Professional subscriptions between 2018-07-05 and 2018-07-15 will be debited.

Example 2:

You have the Professional subscription with billing date 2018-07-15, and it's 2018-07-05, and you want to downgrade to the Streamer plan, then:

* Unused Professional subscriptions between 2018-07-05 and 2018-07-15 will be credited
* Streamer subscriptions between 2018-07-05 and 2018-07-15 will be debited.
* The remaining credit will be applied to future invoices
