API Keys
========

This is your **API Keys page**. It provides the explanation of the two types of API keys offered: **Standard API Keys**, which are static secrets you should keep secure, and **JWT API Keys**. The latter allows you to generate JWT tokens using a private or public key, suitable for scenarios like frontend applications due to their short-lived expiration times.

The page is divided into sections for managing these keys.

In the "**Standard API Keys**" section, you'll find a "**Create Standard API Key**" button. Below this is a table listing your existing standard keys. This table displays details for each key, including a Name (which is system-generated if not otherwise specified by you), the associated Product (e.g., "Market Data API," "Flat Files API"), a portion of the API Key itself, the Author, its last usage date (indicated in the "Used" column), and its current operational state (shown in the "Status" column, e.g., "Enabled"). Each key also has a delete icon for its removal.

The "**JWT Keys**" section appears below this. Similar to the Standard API Keys section, this area features a "**Create JWT Key**" button and a table listing your existing JWT keys. This table provides comparable information: Name, associated Product, a portion of the JWT Key, Author, its last usage date (under "Used"), and its current Status. Each JWT key can also be removed using its designated delete icon.
