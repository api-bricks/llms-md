This is your starting page when you log in. It gives you direct links to five common actions: You can generate an API key, invite team members, add a payment method, set up auto-recharge, and configure Spend Management.

Beneath these actions, the page displays a section titled "Your teams," where you can manage your current memberships. This area lists all the organizations you are a part of. Each organization is displayed with a button next to it. This button will either say "Select," allowing you to switch to that team, or "Current team," indicating the team you are actively using.

You also have the option to expand your collaborations by creating new teams. You'll find a "Create new team" link displayed directly under the "Your teams" heading. Additionally, at the very bottom of the list of your current organizations, there is a button also labeled "Create new team." The page also informs you of the total number of teams you are associated with.
