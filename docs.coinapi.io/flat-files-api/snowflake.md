Frequently Asked Questions[​](/flat-files-api/snowflake/#frequently-asked-questions "Direct link to Frequently Asked Questions")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Why is delivery via Snowflake important?[​](/flat-files-api/snowflake/#why-is-delivery-via-snowflake-important "Direct link to Why is delivery via Snowflake important?")

Snowflake provides advantages in terms of query performance, data integration, scalability, security, ease of use, and data transformation. These benefits make it a valuable option for our customers who want to access and analyze historical data, even when alternative methods like REST API and Amazon S3 are available. Snowflake complements these methods by offering a comprehensive data warehousing solution for more advanced analytics and data management needs.

### How does a customer get access to these datasets?[​](/flat-files-api/snowflake/#how-does-a-customer-get-access-to-these-datasets "Direct link to How does a customer get access to these datasets?")

Customers will need to have their own Snowflake account in which we will share access. If you are interested in accessing data via Snowflake, please contact us or reach out to your Account Executive.

### How do I download Snowflake sample files to see which fields are returned?[​](/flat-files-api/snowflake/#how-do-i-download-snowflake-sample-files-to-see-which-fields-are-returned "Direct link to How do I download Snowflake sample files to see which fields are returned?")

Sample files are available in [Snowflake's Marketplace](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/providers/GZSYZR8QYH/CoinAPI) where you can easily access and review the data structure. Each dataset's documentation provides a detailed schema of available fields.
